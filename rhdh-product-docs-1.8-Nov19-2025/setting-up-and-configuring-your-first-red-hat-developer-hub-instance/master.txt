# Setting up and configuring your first Red Hat Developer Hub instance

Prepare your IT infrastructure including Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and required external components, and run your first Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) instance in production.

# Checklist to run your first Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) instance in production.

With the default configuration, Developer Hub runs with a minimal feature set that does not require secure connection to external services such as an identity provider, a Git provider, and external PostgreSQL and Redis databases.

Using critical features therefore requires following additional configuration:

For resiliency:: 
* Use an external PostgreSQL database.
* Enable high-availability.
For performance:: 
* Enable assets caching to an external Redis database.
For security:: 
* Use secure connections to your external services.
* Provision users and enable authentication.
* Enable role-based access control, and configure the permission policy by using the Web UI.
For adapting to your environment:: 
* Enable GitHub repository discovery.
* Customize Developer Hub appearance with your logo.

# Installing the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator

As an administrator, you can install the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator. Authorized users can use the Operator to install Red Hat Developer Hub on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OpenShift Container Platform) and supported Kubernetes platforms. For more information on supported platforms and versions, see the Red Hat Developer Hub Life Cycle page.

Containers are available for the following CPU architectures:

* AMD64 and Intel 64 (x86_64)

* You are logged in as an administrator on the OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You have configured the appropriate roles and permissions within your project to create or access an application. For more information, see the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation on Building applications.
* You have installed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 to 4.19.
* Make sure that your system meets the minimum sizing requirements. See Sizing requirements for Red Hat Developer Hub.

1. In the navigation menu of the OpenShift Container Platform console, click Operators > OperatorHub.
2. In the Filter by keyword box, enter Developer Hub and click the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator card.
3. On the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator page, read the information about the Operator and click Install to open the Install Operator page.
4. After the Operator is successfully installed, provision your custom configuration:

Before you create a Developer Hub instance, you must create the required config map and Secret resources in your project. These include the baseUrl and service-to-service authentication secrets.

For detailed steps, see Provisioning your custom Red Hat Developer Hub configuration.
5. From the Update channel drop-down menu, select the update channel that you want to use, for example, fast or fast-1.8.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The `fast channel includes all of the updates available for a particular version. Any update might introduce unexpected changes in your Red Hat Developer Hub deployment. Check the release notes for details about any potentially breaking changes.
The fast-1.8 channel only provides z-stream updates, for example, updating from version 1.8.1 to 1.8.2. If you want to update the Red Hat Developer Hub y-version in the future, for example, updating from 1.8 to 1.9, you must switch to the fast-1.9 channel manually.
----
6. From the Version drop-down menu, select the version of the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator that you want to install. The default version is the latest version available in the selected channel.
7. Select the Operator Installation mode.

[NOTE]
----
The All namespaces on the cluster (default) option is selected by default. The Specific namespace on the cluster option is not currently supported.
----
8. In the Installed Namespace field, do one of the following actions:
* Select Operator recommended Namespace to create and use the rhdh-operator namespace. This option is selected by default.
* Select Select a Namespace to use an alternative namespace.
* From the Select Project drop-down menu, do one of the following actions:
* Select an existing project.
* Select Create Project to create a new project for the Operator.
* On the Create Project dialog, enter text into the required fields and click Create.

[IMPORTANT]
----
For enhanced security, better control over the Operator lifecycle, and preventing potential privilege escalation, install the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator in a dedicated default rhdh-operator namespace. You can restrict other users' access to the Operator resources through role bindings or cluster role bindings.
You can also install the Operator in another namespace by creating the necessary resources, such as an Operator group. For more information, see Installing global Operators in custom namespaces.
However, if the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator shares a namespace with other Operators, then it shares the same update policy as well, preventing the customization of the update policy. For example, if one Operator is set to manual updates, the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator update policy is also set to manual. For more information, see Colocation of Operators in a namespace.
----
9. Select the Update approval method for the Operator.
* If you select the Automatic option, the Operator is updated without requiring manual confirmation.
* If you select the Manual option, a notification opens when a new update is released in the update channel. The update must be manually approved by an administrator before installation can begin.
10. Click Install.

[NOTE]
----
If you selected a Manual approval strategy, the upgrade status of the subscription remains Upgrading until you review and approve the install plan. After you click Approve on the Install Plan page, the subscription upgrade status changes to Up to date.
If you selected an Automatic approval strategy, the upgrade status should resolve to Up to date without intervention.
----

* Immediately after the Operator is installed, the dialog box on the OperatorHub page displays the Installed operator: ready for use message.
* From the dialog box, do one of the following actions:
* Click View Operator to open the Operator details page for the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator.
* Click View all installed operators to open the Installed Operators page.
* From the list of installed Operators, locate the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator name and details.
* Click Red Hat Developer Hub Operator to open the Operator details page for the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator.

To configure Red Hat Developer Hub, provision your custom Red Hat Developer Hub config maps and secrets to {platform-long} before running Red Hat Developer Hub.


[TIP]
----
On Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can skip this step to run Developer Hub with the default config map and secret.
Your changes on this configuration might get reverted on Developer Hub restart.
----

* By using the {platform-cli-link}, you have access, with developer permissions, to the OpenShift cluster aimed at containing your Developer Hub instance.
* You have the connection string to an active Redis server, such as rediss://user:pass@cache.example.com:6379.
For security, consider using a rediss secure server connection.
See .

NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS: /opt/app-root/src/postgres-crt.pem
```

5. Enter your authentication secrets.
2. Author your custom app-config.yaml file.
This is the main Developer Hub configuration file.
You need a custom app-config.yaml file to avoid the Developer Hub installer to revert user edits during upgrades.
When your custom app-config.yaml file is empty, Developer Hub is using default values.
1. For a production environment, start with the following setup:
app-config.yaml

```yaml
app:
  title: <Red Hat Developer Hub>
  branding:
    fullLogo: ${BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO}
    fullLogoWidth: 110px
    iconLogo: ${BASE64_EMBEDDED_ICON_LOGO}
backend:
  cache:
    store: redis
    connection: ${REDIS_CONNECTION}
techdocs:
  cache:
    ttl: 3600000
catalog:
  providers:
    <enter_your_provider_configuration>
integrations:
    <enter_your_integrations_configuration>
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    admin:
      users:
        - name: user:default/<your_policy_administrator_name>
    pluginsWithPermission:
      - catalog
      - scaffolder
      - permission
```


Most fields use environment variables that you defined in secrets in the previous step.
app:: 
title:: Enter your Developer Hub instance display name, such as <Red Hat Developer Hub>.
branding:: Set your custom logo.

Optionally, customize the width of the branding logo by changing value for the fullLogoWidth field. The following units are supported: integer, px, em, rem, percentage.
backend:: 
cache:: Enable the plugins assets cache.
techdocs:: 
cache:: Enable the Techdocs cache.
catalog:: 
provider:: Enter your catalog provider configuration.
integrations:: Enter your repository discovery configuration.
permissions:: Enable Role-based access control.
Enter your policy administrator name.
2. Additionally, provision users and enable authentication with your external identity provider.
3. Author your custom dynamic-plugins.yaml file to enable plugins.
By default, Developer Hub enables a minimal plugin set, and disables plugins that require configuration or secrets, such as the GitHub repository discovery plugin and the Role-based access control (RBAC) plugin.

Enable the GitHub repository discovery and the RBAC features:
dynamic.plugins.yaml

```yaml
includes:
  - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github
    disabled: false
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-rbac
    disabled: false
```

4. Provision your custom configuration files to your {platform} cluster.
1. Create the <my-rhdh-project> {namespace} aimed at containing your Developer Hub instance.

```terminal
$ oc create namespace my-rhdh-project
```

2. Provision your app-config.yaml and dynamic-plugins.yaml files respectively to the my-rhdh-app-config, and dynamic-plugins-rhdh config maps in the <my-rhdh-project> project.

```terminal
$ oc create configmap my-rhdh-app-config --from-file=app-config.yaml --namespace=my-rhdh-project
$ oc create configmap dynamic-plugins-rhdh --from-file=dynamic-plugins.yaml --namespace=my-rhdh-project
```


Alternatively,
create the config maps by using the web console.
3. Provision your secrets.txt file to the my-rhdh-secrets secret in the <my-rhdh-project> project.

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic my-rhdh-secrets --from-file=secrets.txt --namespace=my-rhdh-project
```


Alternatively,
create the secret by using the web console.
4. Provision your PosgreSQL TLS certificates to the my-rhdh-database-secrets secret in the <my-rhdh-project> project.

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic my-rhdh-secrets --from-file=postgres-ca.pem --from-file=postgres-crt.pem --from-file=postgres-key.key --namespace=my-rhdh-project
```


# Enabling authentication in Red Hat Developer Hub (with mandatory steps only)

## Understanding authentication and user provisioning

Learn about the authentication process from creating user and group entities in the software catalog to user sign-in, and how authentication and catalog plugins enable each step.
Understanding this process is essential for successfully configuring your Developer Hub instance, securing access through authorization, and enabling features that rely on synchronized user and group data.

To fully enable catalog features, provision user and group data from the Identity Provider to the Developer Hub software catalog.
Catalog provider plugins handle this task asynchronously.
These plugins query the Identity Provider (IdP) for relevant user and group information, and create or update corresponding entities in the Developer Hub catalog.
Scheduled provisioning ensures that the catalog accurately reflects the users and groups in your organization.

When a user attempts to access Developer Hub, Developer Hub redirects them to a configured authentication provider, such as Red Hat Build of Keycloak (RHBK), GitHub, or Microsoft Azure.
This external IdP is responsible for authenticating the user.

On successful authentication, the Developer Hub authentication plugin, configured in your app-config.yaml file, processes the response from the IdP, resolves the identity in the Developer Hub software catalog, and establishes a user session within Developer Hub.

Configuring authentication and user provisioning is critical for several reasons.

* Securing your Developer Hub instance by ensuring only authenticated users can gain access.
* Enabling authorization by allowing you to define access controls based on user and group memberships synchronized from your IdP.
* Provisioning user and group data to the catalog is necessary for various catalog features that rely on understanding entity ownership and relationships between users, groups, and software components.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Without this provisioning step, features such as displaying who owns a catalog entity might not function correctly.
----


[TIP]
----
To explore Developer Hub features in a non-production environment, you can:
* To use Developer Hub without external IdP, enable the guest user to skip configuring authentication and authorization, log in as the guest user, and access all Developer Hub features.
* To use Developer Hub without authorization policies and features relying on the software catalog, you can enable the dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog resolver option.
This setting bypasses the check requiring a user to be in the catalog but still enforces authentication.
----


[IMPORTANT]
----
Developer Hub uses a one-way synchronization model, where user and group data flow from your Identity Provider to the Developer Hub software catalog.
As a result,
deleting users or groups manually through the Developer Hub Web UI or REST API might be ineffective or cause inconsistencies,
since Developer Hub will create those entities again during the next import.
----

## Authenticating with the Guest user

For trial or non-production environments, you can enable guest access to skip configuring authentication and authorization and explore Developer Hub features.

### Authenticating with the Guest user on an Operator-based installation

For trial or non-production environments installed by using the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator, you can enable guest access to skip configuring authentication and authorization and explore Developer Hub features.

* You added a custom Developer Hub application configuration, and have enough permissions to change it.
* You use the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator to run Developer Hub.

* Add the following content to the app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
auth:
  environment: development
  providers:
    guest:
      dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment: true
```


1. Go to the Developer Hub login page.
2. To log in with the Guest user account, click Enter in the Guest tile.
3. In the Developer Hub Settings page, your profile name is Guest.
4. You can use Developer Hub features.

### Authenticating with the Guest user on a Helm-based installation

2. To log in with the Guest user account, click Enter in the Guest tile.
3. In the Developer Hub Settings page, your profile name is Guest.
4. You can use Developer Hub features.

## Enabling user authentication with Red Hat Build of Keycloak (RHBK)

Authenticate users with Red Hat Build of Keycloak (RHBK), by provisioning the users and groups from RHBK to the Developer Hub software catalog, and configuring the OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication provider in Red Hat Developer Hub.

* You added a custom Developer Hub application configuration, and have enough permissions to change it.
* You have enough permissions in RHSSO to create and manage a realm and a client.

[TIP]
----
Alternatively, ask your RHBK administrator to prepare in RHBK the required realm and client.
----

1. Register your Developer Hub app in RHBK:
1. Use an existing realm, or create a realm, with a distinctive Name such as <my_realm>.
Save the value for the next step:
* RHBK realm base URL, such as: <your_rhbk_URL>/realms/<your_realm>.
2. To register your Developer Hub in RHBK, in the created realm, secure the first application, with:
1. Client ID: A distinctive client ID, such as <RHDH>.
2. Valid redirect URIs: Set to the OIDC handler URL: https://<my_developer_hub_domain>/api/auth/oidc/handler/frame.
3. Go to the Credentials tab and copy the Client secret.
4. Save the values for the next step:
* Client ID
* Client Secret
3. To prepare for the verification steps, in the same realm, get the credential information for an existing user or create a user.
Save the user credential information for the verification steps.
2. Add your RHSSO credentials to Developer Hub, by
adding the following key/value pairs to your Developer Hub secrets.
You can use these secrets in the Developer Hub configuration files by using their environment variable name.
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID:: Enter the saved Client ID.
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET:: Enter the saved Client Secret.
KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL:: Enter the saved RHBK realm base URL.
KEYCLOAK_REALM:: Enter the realm name to provision users.
KEYCLOAK_LOGIN_REALM:: Enter the realm name to authenticate users.
3. Enable the Keycloak catalog provider plugin in your dynamic-plugins.yaml file.

The plugin is named after RHBK upstream project.

This plugin imports RHBK users and groups to the Developer Hub software catalog.

```yaml
plugins:
  - package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-catalog-backend-module-keycloak-dynamic'
    disabled: false
```

4. Enable provisioning RHBK users and groups to the Developer Hub software catalog, by adding the catalog.providers.keycloakOrg section to your app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
catalog:
  providers:
    keycloakOrg:
      default:
        baseUrl: ${KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL}
        clientId: ${KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID}
        clientSecret: ${KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET}
        realm: ${KEYCLOAK_REALM}
        loginRealm: ${KEYCLOAK_LOGIN_REALM}
```

baseUrl:: Enter your RHBK server URL, defined earlier.
clientId:: Enter your Developer Hub application client ID in RHBK, defined earlier.
clientSecret:: Enter your Developer Hub application client secret in RHBK, defined earlier.
realm:: Enter the realm name to provision users.
loginRealm:: Enter the realm name to authenticate users.

Optional: To configure optional fields, see Configuring Red Hat Developer Hub.
5. 
Enable the RHBK authentication provider, by adding the OIDC provider section in your  app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
auth:
  environment: production
  providers:
    oidc:
      production:
        metadataUrl: ${KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL}
        clientId: ${KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID}
        clientSecret: ${KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET}
        prompt: auto
signInPage: oidc
```

environment: production:: Mark the environment as production to hide the Guest login in the Developer Hub home page.
metadataUrl, clientId, clientSecret:: Configure the OIDC provider with your secrets.
prompt:: Enter auto to allow the identity provider to automatically determine whether to prompt for credentials or bypass the login redirect if an active RHSSO session exists.

The identity provider defaults to none, which assumes that you are already logged in. Sign-in requests without an active session are rejected.
signInPage:: Enter oidc to enable the OIDC provider as default sign-in provider.

Optional: To configure optional fields, see Configuring Red Hat Developer Hub.

1. To verify user and group provisioning, check the console logs.

Successful synchronization example:

```
2025-06-27T16:02:34.647Z catalog info Read 5 Keycloak users and 3 Keycloak groups in 0.4 seconds. Committing... class="KeycloakOrgEntityProvider" taskId="KeycloakOrgEntityProvider:default:refresh" taskInstanceId="db55c34b-46b3-402b-b12f-2fbc48498e82" trace_id="606f80a9ce00d1c86800718c4522f7c6" span_id="7ebc2a254a546e90" trace_flags="01"

2025-06-27T16:02:34.650Z catalog info Committed 5 Keycloak users and 3 Keycloak groups in 0.0 seconds. class="KeycloakOrgEntityProvider" taskId="KeycloakOrgEntityProvider:default:refresh" taskInstanceId="db55c34b-46b3-402b-b12f-2fbc48498e82" trace_id="606f80a9ce00d1c86800718c4522f7c6" span_id="7ebc2a254a546e90" trace_flags="01"
```

2. To verify RHBK user authentication:
1. Go to the Developer Hub login page.
2. Your Developer Hub sign-in page displays Sign in using OIDC and the Guest user sign-in is disabled.
3. Log in with OIDC by using the saved Username and Password values.

## Enabling user authentication with GitHub

Authenticate users with GitHub by provisioning the users and groups from GitHub to the Developer Hub software catalog, and configuring the GitHub authentication provider in Red Hat Developer Hub.

* Integrating Red Hat Developer Hub with GitHub

## Enabling user authentication with Microsoft Azure

Authenticate users with Microsoft Azure by provisioning the users and groups from Azure to the Developer Hub software catalog, and configuring the Azure authentication provider in Red Hat Developer Hub.

* You have the permission to register an application in Azure.

[TIP]
----
Alternatively, ask your Azure administrator to prepare the required Azure application.
----
* You added a custom Developer Hub application configuration, and have enough permissions to change it.
* Your Developer Hub backend can access the following hosts:
login.microsoftonline.com:: The Microsoft Azure authorization server, which enables the authentication flow.
graph.microsoft.com:: The server for retrieving organization data, including user and group data, to import into the Developer Hub catalog.

1. Register your Developer Hub app in Azure, by using the Azure portal.
1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center.
2. Optional: If you have access to multiple tenants, use the Settings icon in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application from the Directories + subscriptions menu.
3. Browse to Applications > App registrations, and create a New registration with the configuration:
Name:: Enter a name to identify your application in Azure, such as {my-product-app-name-in-azure}.
Supported account types:: Select Accounts in this organizational directory only.
Redirect URI:: 
Select a platform:: Select Web.
URL:: Enter the backend authentication URI set in Developer Hub: https://<my_developer_hub_domain>/api/auth/microsoft/handler/frame
4. On the Applications > App registrations > {my-product-app-name-in-azure} > Manage > API permissions page, Add a Permission, Microsoft Graph, select the following permissions:
Application Permissions:: 
GroupMember.Read.All, User.Read.All:: Enter permissions that enable provisioning user and groups to the Developer Hub software catalog.

Optional: Grant admin consent for these permissions.
Even if your company does not require admin consent, consider doing so as it means users do not need to individually consent the first time they access Developer Hub.
Delegated Permissions:: 
User.Read, email, offline_access, openid, profile:: Enter permissions that enable authenticating users.

Optional: Enter optional custom scopes for the Microsoft Graph API that you define both here and in your app-config.yaml Developer Hub configuration file.
5. On the Applications > App registrations > {my-product-app-name-in-azure} > Manage > Certificates & secrets page, in the Client secrets tab, create a New client secret.
6. Save the following values for the next step:
* Directory (tenant) ID
* Application (client) ID
* Application (client) Secret ID
2. Add your Azure credentials to Developer Hub, by adding the following key/value pairs to your Developer Hub secrets:
MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID:: Enter your saved Directory (tenant) ID.
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID:: Enter your saved Application (client) ID.
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET:: Enter your saved Application (client) secret.
3. Enable the Microsoft Graph catalog provider plugin in your dynamic-plugins.yaml
file.
This plugin imports Azure users and groups to the Developer Hub software catalog.

```yaml
plugins:
  - package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-msgraph-dynamic'
    disabled: false
```

4. Enable provisioning Azure users and groups to the Developer Hub software catalog, by adding the Microsoft Graph catalog provider section in your app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
catalog:
  providers:
    microsoftGraphOrg:
      providerId:
        target: https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0
        tenantId: ${MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID}
        clientId: ${MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID}
        clientSecret: ${MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET}
        schedule:
          frequency:
            hours: 1
          timeout:
            minutes: 50
          initialDelay:
            minutes: 50
```

target:: Enter https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0 to define the MSGraph API endpoint the provider is connecting to.
You might change this parameter to use a different version, such as the beta endpoint.
tenandId:: Enter the configured secret variable name: ${MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID}.
clientId:: Enter the configured secret variable name: ${MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID}.
clientSecret:: Enter the configured secret variable name: ${MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET}.
schedule:: 
frequency:: Enter the schedule frequency in the cron, ISO duration, or human duration format.
In a large organization, user provisioning might take a long time, therefore avoid using a low value.
timeout:: Enter the schedule timeout in the ISO duration or human duration format.
In a large organization, user provisioning might take a long time, therefore avoid using a low value.
initialDelay:: Enter the schedule initial delay in the ISO duration or human duration format.

Enable Azure authentication, by adding the Microsoft authentication provider to your app-config.yaml file content:


```yaml
auth:
  environment: production
  providers:
    microsoft:
      production:
        clientId: ${MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID}
        clientSecret: ${MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET}
        tenantId: ${MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID}
signInPage: microsoft
```


environment:: Enter production to disable the Guest login option in the Developer Hub login page.
clientId:: Enter the configured secret variable name:  ${MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID}.
clientSecret:: Enter the configured secret variable name:
${MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET}.
