# Installing Red Hat Developer Hub in an air-gapped environment

# Air-gapped environment

An air-gapped environment, also known as an air-gapped network or isolated network, ensures security by physically segregating the system or network. This isolation is established to prevent unauthorized access, data transfer, or communication between the air-gapped system and external sources.

You can install the Red Hat Developer Hub in an air-gapped environment to ensure security and meet specific regulatory requirements.

# Installing Red Hat Developer Hub in an air-gapped environment with the Operator

You can install Red Hat Developer Hub in a fully disconnected or partially disconnected environment using the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator. For a list of supported platforms, see the Red Hat Developer Hub Life Cycle page.

## Installing Red Hat Developer Hub in a fully disconnected environment with the Operator

In environments without internet access — whether for security, compliance, or operational reasons — a fully disconnected installation ensures that Red Hat Developer Hub can run reliably without external dependencies.

If your network has access to the registry through a bastion host, you can use the helper script to install Red Hat Developer Hub by mirroring the Operator-related images to disk and transferring them to your air-gapped environment without any connection to the internet.

* You have installed Podman 5.3 or later. For more information, see Podman Installation Instructions.
* You have installed Skopeo 1.17 or later.
* You have installed yq 4.44 or later.
* You have installed the GNU sed command line text editor.
* You have installed umoci CLI tool.
* You have an active oc registry, podman, or skopeo session to the Red Hat Container Registry (registry.redhat.io). For more information, see Red Hat Container Registry Authentication.
* You have installed the opm CLI tool. For more information, see Installing the opm CLI.
* Recommended on OpenShift Container Platform: You have installed the oc-mirror tool, with a version corresponding to the version of your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* Make sure that your system meets the minimum sizing requirements. See Sizing requirements for Red Hat Developer Hub.

1. Download the mirroring script to disk by running the following command:

```terminal
curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/refs/heads/release-1.8/.rhdh/scripts/prepare-restricted-environment.sh
```

2. Run the mirroring script by using the bash command with the appropriate set of options:

```terminal
bash prepare-restricted-environment.sh
 --filter-versions "1.8"
 --to-dir <my_pulled_image_location>
 [--use-oc-mirror true]
```


where:
--to-dir <my_pulled_image_location>:: Enter the absolute path to a directory where you want to pull all of the necessary images, for example, /home/user/rhdh-operator-mirror-dir.
--use-oc-mirror true:: (Recommended on OpenShift Container Platform) Use the oc-mirror OpenShift Container Platform CLI plugin to mirror images.

[NOTE]
----
The script can take several minutes to complete as it copies multiple images to the mirror registry.
----
3. Transfer the directory specified by the --to-dir option to your disconnected environment.
4. From a machine in your disconnected environment that has access to both the cluster and the target mirror registry, run the mirroring script by using the bash command with the appropriate set of options:

```terminal
bash <my_pulled_image_location>/install.sh
    --from-dir <my_pulled_image_location>
    [--to-registry <my.registry.example.com>]
    [--use-oc-mirror true]
```


where:
<my_pulled_image_location>/install.sh:: Enter the downloaded installation script and the absolute path to the directory where it is stored on your system.
--from-dir <my_pulled_image_location>:: Enter the directory where you want to pull all of the necessary images.
--to-registry:: (Optional) Enter the URL for the target mirror registry where you want to mirror the images.
--use-oc-mirror true:: Recommended on OpenShift Container Platform: Use the oc-mirror OpenShift Container Platform CLI plugin to mirror images.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you used oc-mirror to mirror the images to disk, you must also use oc-mirror to mirror the images from disk due to the folder layout that oc-mirror uses.
----

[NOTE]
----
The script can take several minutes to complete as it automatically installs the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator.
----

* If you are using Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator is in the Installed Operators list in the web console.
* If you are using a supported Kubernetes platform, you can check the list of pods running in the rhdh-operator namespace by running the following command in your terminal:

```terminal
kubectl -n rhdh-operator get pods
```


* Use the Operator to create a Red Hat Developer Hub instance on a supported platform. For more information, see the following documentation for the platform that you want to use:
* Installing Red Hat Developer Hub on OpenShift Container Platform with the Operator
* Installing Developer Hub on EKS with the Operator
* Installing Developer Hub on AKS with the Operator
* Installing Developer Hub on Google Cloud with the Operator
* Deploying Developer Hub on GKE with the Operator

## Installing Red Hat Developer Hub in a partially disconnected environment with the Operator

On an OpenShift Container Platform cluster operating on a restricted network, public resources are not available.
However, deploying the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator and running Developer Hub requires the following public resources:

* Operator images (bundle, operator, catalog)
* Operands images (RHDH, PostgreSQL)

To make these resources available, replace them with their equivalent resources in a mirror registry accessible to your cluster.

You can use a helper script that mirrors the necessary images and provides the necessary configuration to ensure those images are used when installing the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator and creating Developer Hub instances.
This script requires a target mirror registry.
You likely have a target mirror registry if your cluster is already operating on a disconnected network.
If you do not already have a target registry, and if you have an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you might want to expose and leverage the internal cluster registry.

When connected to a OpenShift Container Platform cluster, the helper script detects it and automatically exposes the cluster registry.
If connected to a Kubernetes cluster, you can manually specify the target registry to mirror the images.

* You have installed Podman 5.3 or later.
For more information, see Podman Installation Instructions.
* You have installed Skopeo 1.17 or later.
* You have installed yq 4.44 or later.
* You have installed the GNU sed command line text editor.
* You have installed umoci CLI tool.
* You have an active oc registry, podman, or Skopeo session to the Red Hat Container Registry (registry.redhat.io).
For more information, see link:Red Hat Container Registry Authentication.
* You have an active Skopeo session with administrative access to the target mirror registry.
For more information, see Authenticating to a registry.
* You have installed the opm CLI tool.
For more information, see Installing the opm CLI.
* If you are using an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you have the following prerequisites:
* Recommended: You have installed the oc-mirror tool, with a version corresponding to the version of your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* If you are using a supported Kubernetes cluster, you have the following prerequisites:
* You have installed the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on the disconnected cluster.
* You have a mirror registry that is reachable from the disconnected cluster.
* Make sure that your system meets the minimum sizing requirements.
See Sizing requirements for Red Hat Developer Hub.

1. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to save the mirroring script.
2. Download the mirroring script by running the following command:

```terminal
curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/refs/heads/release-1.8/.rhdh/scripts/prepare-restricted-environment.sh
```

3. Run the mirroring script by using the bash command with the appropriate set of options:

```terminal
bash prepare-restricted-environment.sh \
 --filter-versions "1.8" \
  [--to-registry <my.registry.example.com>] \
  [--use-oc-mirror true]
```


where:
--to-registry _<my.registry.example.com>:: Enter the URL for the target mirror registry where you want to mirror the images.
--use-oc-mirror true:: Optional: Use the oc-mirror OpenShift Container Platform CLI plugin to mirror images.

[NOTE]

# Installing Red Hat Developer Hub on OpenShift Container Platform in an air-gapped environment with the Helm chart

You can install Red Hat Developer Hub in a fully disconnected or partially disconnected environment using the Red Hat Developer Hub Helm chart.

## Installing Red Hat Developer Hub on OpenShift Container Platform in a fully disconnected environment with the Helm chart

If your network has access to the registry through a bastion host, you can use the Helm chart to install Red Hat Developer Hub by mirroring specified resources to disk and transferring them to your air-gapped environment without any connection to the internet.

* You have set up your workstation.
* You have an account in Red Hat Developer portal.
* You have access to the charts.openshift.io Helm chart repository.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc) on your workstation.
* You have installed the oc-mirror tool, with a version corresponding to the version of your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You have set up your intermediary host.
* Your host has access to the Red Hat Container Registry (registry.redhat.io).
* Your host has access to image registry on the destination host.
See Exposing the registry.
* You have set up your destination host.
* You have installed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 or later.
* Your system meets the minimum sizing requirements. See Sizing requirements for Red Hat Developer Hub.

1. Create an ImageSetConfiguration file to specify the resources that you want to mirror. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:
  helm:
    repositories:
      - name: openshift-charts
        url: https://charts.openshift.io
        charts:
          - name: redhat-developer-hub
            version: "1.8"
```


where:
version: "1.8":: Enter the Red Hat Developer Hub version to mirror.
2. Mirror the resources specified in the ImageSetConfiguration.yaml file by running the oc-mirror command. For example:

```terminal
oc-mirror --config=<mirror_config_directory>/ImageSetConfiguration.yaml <mirror_archive_directory>/
```

where:
<mirror_config_directory>:: Enter the location of your image set configuration file on your system, for example, .user.
<mirror_archive_directory>:: Enter the location of your directory where the mirror archive will be created, for example, file://.user.

[NOTE]
----
Running the oc-mirror command generates a local workspace containing the mirror archive file, the Helm chart, and a ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) manifest. The ICSP manifest contains an imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml file that you must apply against the cluster in a later step.
----

Example output:

```terminal
Creating archive /path/to/mirror-archive/mirror_seq1_000000.tar
```

3. Transfer the generated archive file (for example, mirror_seq1_000000.tar) to the air-gapped environment.
4. Connect to your air-gapped environment and make sure that you are also connected to the following objects:
* The local target registry
* The target OpenShift Container Platform cluster
5. From your air-gapped environment, mirror the resources from the archive to the target registry by running the oc-mirror command. For example:

```terminal
oc-mirror --from <mirror-archive-file> <target-registry>
```

where:
<mirror_archive_file>:: Enter the name of the file containing the resources that you want to mirror, for example,mirror_seq1_0000.tar.
<target_registry>:: Enter the name of the target registry that you want to push the mirrored images to, for example, docker://registry.localhost:5000.
Example output

```terminal

Writing image mapping to oc-mirror-workspace/results-1738075410/mapping.txt
Writing ICSP manifests to oc-mirror-workspace/results-1738075410
```

6. In your workspace, locate the imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml file by running the ls command. For example:

```terminal
ls <workspace_directory>/<results_directory>
```

where:
<workspace_directory>:: Specifies the name of your workspace directory, for example, oc-mirror-workspace.
<results_directory>:: Specifies the name of your results directory, for example, results-1738070846.
7. To mirror the Helm chart, deploy the imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml file in the disconnected cluster by running the oc apply command. For example:

```terminal
oc apply -f <workspace_directory>/<results_directory>/ImageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
```

where:
<workspace-directory>:: Enter the name of your workspace directory, for example, oc-mirror-workspace.
<results-directory>:: Enter the name of your results directory, for example, results-1738070846.
8. In your air-gapped environment, deploy the Helm chart to the namespace that you want to use by running the helm install command with namespace and set options. For example:

```terminal
CLUSTER_ROUTER_BASE=$(oc get route console -n openshift-console -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}' | sed 's/[.]*\.//')

helm install <rhdh_instance> <workspace_directory>/<results_directory>/charts/<archive_file> --namespace <your_namespace> --create-namespace \
  --set global.clusterRouterBase="$CLUSTER_ROUTER_BASE"
```

where:
<rhdh_instance>:: Enter the name of your Red Hat Developer Hub instance, for example, my-rhdh-project.

* Red Hat Container Registry Authentication

# Installing Red Hat Developer Hub on a supported Kubernetes platform in an air-gapped environment with the Helm chart

If you are using a supported Kubernetes platform in a fully disconnected or partially disconnected environment, you can install Red Hat Developer Hub by using the Helm chart.
Supported Kubernetes platforms include the following:

* Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
* Google Kubernetes Engine

## Installing Red Hat Developer Hub on a supported Kubernetes platform in a fully disconnected environment with the Helm chart

In environments without internet access, a fully disconnected installation ensures that Red Hat Developer Hub can run reliably without external dependencies. This approach involves mirroring images and transferring them manually to the air-gapped environment.

* You have installed Skopeo 1.17 or later
* You have installed Yq 4.4 or later
* You authenticated to registry.redhat.io for pulling images by using the skopeo login command.
* You have access to the Kubernetes cluster with kubectl configured
* You have installed Helm 3.13 or later on the air-gapped host

1. On the mirroring host, in a terminal, fetch the Helm charts values by running the following commands:

```terminal
helm repo add <helm_chart_repo_name> https://charts.openshift.io/
helm repo update
helm show values <helm_chart_repo_name>/redhat-developer-hub --version <rhdh_version>  values.default.yaml
helm pull <helm_chart_repo_name>/redhat-developer-hub --version <rhdh_version>
```


where
<helm_chart_repo_name>:: Specifies the name of the Helm chart repository, for example, openshift-helm-charts.
<rhdh_version>:: Specifies the Red Hat Developer Hub version that you want to use, for example, 1.8.0.

[NOTE]
----
The helm pull <helm_chart_repo_name>/redhat-developer-hub --version <rhdh_version> command automatically creates the Helm chart archive file and downloads the Helm chart to your current working directory.
----
2. Extract the image digests by running the following commands:

```terminal
RHDH_IMAGE=$(yq '.upstream.backstage.image | .registry + "/" + .repository' values.default.yaml)
RHDH_DIGEST=$(yq '.upstream.backstage.image.tag' values.default.yaml)
PG_IMAGE=$(yq '.upstream.postgresql.image | .registry + "/" + .repository' values.default.yaml)
PG_DIGEST=$(yq '.upstream.postgresql.image.tag' values.default.yaml)
```

3. Mirror the images to your local archive by running the following commands:

```terminal
skopeo login registry.redhat.io
skopeo copy --all docker://${RHDH_IMAGE}:${RHDH_DIGEST} dir:./rhdh-hub
skopeo copy --all docker://${PG_IMAGE}:${PG_DIGEST} dir:./postgresql
```

4. Transfer the following files and directories to your air-gapped environment:
* rhdh-hub
* postgresql
* Helm chart archive file, for example, redhat-developer-hub-1.8.0.tgz
5. Load the images onto the air-gapped host by running the following commands:

```terminal
skopeo copy --all dir:./rhdh-hub docker://<mirror_registry_name>/<rhdh_repo_name>:${RHDH_DIGEST}

skopeo copy --all dir:./postgresql docker://<mirror_registry_name>/<postgresql_repo_name>:${PG_DIGEST}
```


where
<mirror_registry_name>:: Specifies the name of the target mirror registry that you want to push the images to, for example, registry.example.com.
<rhdh_repo_name>:: Specifies the name of the repository where your Red Hat Developer Hub image is stored, for example, rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9. This value must match the name of the Red Hat Developer Hub image that you loaded onto the air-gapped host.
<postgresql_repo_name>:: Specifies the name of the repository where your PostgreSQL image is stored, for example, rhdh/postgresql-15.
6. Create a values.yaml file for the Kubernetes platform that you want to use and add the following image references to the file to reflect local use:

```yaml
upstream:
  backstage:
    image:
      registry: "<mirror_registry_name>"
      repository: <rhdh_repo_name>
      tag: "${RHDH_DIGEST}"

  postgresql:
    image:
      registry: "<mirror_registry_name>"
      repository: <postgresql_repo_name>
      tag: "${PG_DIGEST}"
```


where
<mirror_registry_name>:: Specifies the name of the target mirror registry that you want to push the images to, for example, registry.example.com.
<rhdh_repo_name>:: Specifies the name of the repository where your Red Hat Developer Hub image is stored, for example, rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9. This value must match the name of the Red Hat Developer Hub image that you loaded onto the air-gapped host.
<postgresql_repo_name>:: Specifies the name of the repository where your PostgreSQL image is stored, for example, rhdh/postgresql-15.
* For AKS, use the following values.yaml file template:

```terminal
RHDH_IMAGE=$(yq '.upstream.backstage.image | .registry + "/" + .repository' values.default.yaml)
RHDH_DIGEST=$(yq '.upstream.backstage.image.tag' values.default.yaml)
PG_IMAGE=$(yq '.upstream.postgresql.image | .registry + "/" + .repository' values.default.yaml)
PG_DIGEST=$(yq '.upstream.postgresql.image.tag' values.default.yaml)
```

3. Mirror the images to the internal mirror registry by entering the following commands:

```terminal
skopeo login registry.redhat.io

skopeo login _<mirror_registry_name>_

skopeo copy --remove-signatures \
  docker://${PG_IMAGE}@${PG_DIGEST} \
  docker://_<mirror_registry_name>_/_<postgresql_repo_name>_:${PG_DIGEST}

skopeo copy --remove-signatures \
  docker://${RHDH_IMAGE}@${RHDH_DIGEST} \
  docker://_<mirror_registry_name>_/_<rhdh_repo_name>_${RHDH_DIGEST}
```


where
<mirror_registry_name>:: Specifies the name of the internal mirror registry, for example, registry.internal.example.com.
<postgresql_repo_name>:: Specifies the name of the PostgreSQL repository, for example, rhdh/postgresql-15.
<rhdh_repo_name>:: Specifies the name of the Red Hat Developer Hub repository, for example, rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9.
4. Create a values.yaml file for the Kubernetes platform that you want to use and add the following image references to the file to reflect local use:

```yaml
upstream:
  backstage:
    image:
      registry: "_<mirror_registry_name>_"
      repository: _<rhdh_repo_name>_
      tag: "${RHDH_DIGEST}"

  postgresql:
    image:
      registry: "_<mirror_registry_name>_"
      repository: _<postgresql_repo_name>_
      tag: "${PG_DIGEST}"
```

* For AKS, use the following values.yaml file template:

```yaml
global:
  host: <app_address>
route:
  enabled: false
upstream:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    className: webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com
    host:
  backstage:
    image:
      pullSecrets:
        - rhdh-pull-secret
    podSecurityContext:
      fsGroup: 3000
  postgresql:
    image:
      pullSecrets:
        - rhdh-pull-secret
    primary:
      podSecurityContext:
        enabled: true
        fsGroup: 3000
  volumePermissions:
    enabled: true
```

* For EKS, use the following values.yaml file template:

```yaml
global:
  # TODO: Set your application domain name.
  host: <your Developer Hub domain name>

route:
  enabled: false

upstream:
  service:
    # NodePort is required for the ALB to route to the Service
    type: NodePort

  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb

      alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing

      # TODO: Using an ALB HTTPS Listener requires a certificate for your own domain. Fill in the ARN of your certificate, e.g.:
      alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: arn:aws:acm:xxx:xxxx:certificate/xxxxxx

      alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTP": 80}, {"HTTPS":443}]'

      alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: '443'

      # TODO: Set your application domain name.
      external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: <your rhdh domain name>

  backstage:
    image:
      pullSecrets:
      - rhdh-pull-secret
    podSecurityContext:
      # you can assign any random value as fsGroup
      fsGroup: 2000
  postgresql:
    image:
      pullSecrets:
      - rhdh-pull-secret
    primary:
      podSecurityContext:
        enabled: true
        # you can assign any random value as fsGroup
        fsGroup: 3000
  volumePermissions:
    enabled: true
```

* For GKE, use the following values.yaml file template:

```yaml
global:
  host: <rhdh_domain_name>
route:
  enabled: false
upstream:
  service:
    type: NodePort
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: gce
      kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: <ADDRESS_NAME>
      networking.gke.io/managed-certificates: <rhdh_certificate_name>
      networking.gke.io/v1beta1.FrontendConfig: <ingress_security_config>
    className: gce
  backstage:
    image:
      pullSecrets:
      - rhdh-pull-secret
    podSecurityContext:
      fsGroup: 2000
  postgresql:
    image:
      pullSecrets:
      - rhdh-pull-secret
    primary:
      podSecurityContext:
        enabled: true
        fsGroup: 3000
  volumePermissions:
    enabled: true
```

5. Install the Helm chart in the current namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
helm install rhdh ./_<helm_chart_archive_file_name>_ -f values.yaml
```


where
<helm_chart_archive_file_name>:: Specifies the name of the Helm chart archive file, for example, redhat-developer-hub-1.8.0.tgz.

* Deploying Developer Hub on AKS with the Helm chart
* Installing Developer Hub on EKS with the Helm chart
* Installing Developer Hub on GKE with the Helm chart
