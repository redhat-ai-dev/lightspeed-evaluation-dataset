* The kubernetes.clusters.read and kubernetes.resources.read, read permissions to view the Topology panel.
* The kubernetes.proxy use permission to view the pod logs.
* The catalog-entity read permission to view the Red Hat Developer Hub software catalog items.

* You are managing Authorization in Red Hat Developer Hub by using external files.

* Add the following permission policies to your rbac-policy.csv file to create a topology-viewer role that has access to the Topology plugin features, and add the role to the users requiring this authorization:

```
g, user:default/<YOUR_USERNAME>, role:default/topology-viewer
p, role:default/topology-viewer, kubernetes.clusters.read, read, allow 1
p, role:default/topology-viewer, kubernetes.resources.read, read, allow 1
p, role:default/topology-viewer, kubernetes.proxy, use, allow 2
p, role:default/topology-viewer, catalog-entity, read, allow 3
```
