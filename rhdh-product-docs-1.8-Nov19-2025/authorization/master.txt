# Authorization in Red Hat Developer Hub

Administrators can authorize users to perform actions and define what users can do in Developer Hub.
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a security concept that defines how to control access to resources in a system by specifying a mapping between users of the system and the actions that those users can perform on resources in the system.
You can use RBAC to define roles with specific permissions and then assign the roles to users and groups.
RBAC on Developer Hub is built on top of the Permissions framework, which defines RBAC policies in code. Rather than defining policies in code, you can use the Developer Hub RBAC feature to define policies in a declarative fashion by using a simple CSV based format. You can define the policies by using Developer Hub web interface or REST API instead of editing the CSV directly.
An administrator can define authorizations in Developer Hub by taking the following steps:
1. Enable the RBAC feature and give authorized users access to the feature.
2. Define roles and policies by combining the following methods:
* The Developer Hub policy administrator uses the Developer Hub web interface or REST API.
* The Developer Hub administrator edits the main Developer Hub configuration file.
* The Developer Hub administrator edits external files.

# Enabling and giving access to the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature is disabled by default.
Enable the RBAC plugin and declare policy administrators to start using RBAC features.

The permission policies for users and groups in the Developer Hub are managed by permission policy administrators. Only permission policy administrators can access the Role-Based Access Control REST API.

* You have added a custom Developer Hub application configuration, and have necessary permissions to modify it.
* You have enabled an authentication provider.

1. The RBAC plugin is installed but disabled by default.
To enable the  ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-rbac plugin, edit your dynamic-plugins.yaml with the following content.
dynamic-plugins.yaml fragment

```yaml
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-rbac
    disabled: false
```


See Installing and viewing plugins in Red Hat Developer Hub.
2. Declare policy administrators to enable a select number of authenticated users to configure RBAC policies through the REST API or Web UI, instead of modifying the CSV file directly.
The permissions can be specified in a separate CSV file referenced in your my-rhdh-app-config config map, or permissions can be created using the REST API or Web UI.

To declare users such as <your_policy_administrator_name> as policy administrators, edit your custom Developer Hub ConfigMap, such as app-config-rhdh, and add following code to the app-config.yaml content:
app-config.yaml fragment

```yaml
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    admin:
      users:
        - name: user:default/<your_policy_administrator_name>
```

3. In order to display the available permissions provided by installed plugins in the Developer Hub UI, you must supply the corresponding list of plugin IDs. There are two ways to do this, by updating your application configuration or by using the RBAC REST API permissions endpoint.
1. To provide plugins by updating your application configuration, you can specify the plugins with permissions in your app-config.yaml file as follows:
app-config.yaml fragment

```yaml
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    admin:
      users:
        - name: user:default/<your_policy_administrator_name>
    pluginsWithPermission:
      - catalog
      - scaffolder
      - permission
```

2. To specify the plugins with permissions by using the RBAC REST API permissions endpoint, see the RBAC REST API permissions endpoint.

1. Sign out from the existing Red Hat Developer Hub session and log in again using the declared policy administrator account.
2. With RBAC enabled, most features are disabled by default.
1. Navigate to the Catalog page in RHDH.
The Create button is not visible.
You cannot create new components.
2. Navigate to the API page.
The Register button is not visible.

* Explicitly enable permissions to resources in Developer Hub.

# Determining permission policy and role configuration source

You can configure Red Hat Developer Hub policy and roles by using different sources.
To maintain data consistency, Developer Hub associates each permission policy and role with one unique source.
You can only use this source to change the resource.

The available sources are:

Configuration file:: Configure roles and policies in the Developer Hub app-config.yaml configuration file, for instance to declare your policy administrators.

The Configuration file pertains to the default role:default/rbac_admin role provided by the RBAC plugin.
The default role has limited permissions to create, read, update, delete permission policies or roles, and to read catalog entities.

[NOTE]
----
In case the default permissions are insufficient for your administrative requirements, you can create a custom admin role with the required permission policies.
----
REST API:: Configure roles and policies by using the Developer Hub Web UI or by using the REST API.
CSV file:: Configure roles and policies by using external CSV files.
Legacy:: The legacy source applies to policies and roles defined before RBAC backend plugin version 2.1.3, and is the least restrictive among the source location options.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Replace the permissions and roles using the legacy source with the permissions using the REST API or the CSV file sources.
----

* To determine the source of a role or policy, use a GET request.

# Policy effect

The policy effect determines whether the access request must be approved if multiple policy rules match the request.
In Red Hat Developer Hub, when one rule permits and the other denies, the deny rule takes precedence, and the policy effect is to deny.

# Managing role-based access controls (RBAC) using the Red Hat Developer Hub Web UI

Policy administrators can use the Developer Hub web interface (Web UI) to allocate specific roles and permissions to individual users or groups. Allocating roles ensures that access to resources and functionalities is regulated across the Developer Hub.

With the policy administrator role in Developer Hub, you can assign permissions to users and groups. This role allows you to view, create, modify, and delete the roles using  Developer Hub Web UI.

## Creating a role in the Red Hat Developer Hub Web UI

You can create a role in the Red Hat Developer Hub using the Web UI.

* You have enabled RBAC, have a policy administrator role in Developer Hub, and have added plugins with permission.

1. Go to Administration at the bottom of the sidebar in the Developer Hub.
The RBAC tab appears, displaying all the created roles in the Developer Hub.
2. (Optional) Click any role to view the role information on the OVERVIEW page.
3. Click CREATE to create a role.
4. Enter the name and description of the role in the given fields and click NEXT.
5. Add users and groups using the search field, and click NEXT.
6. Select Plugin and Permission from the drop-downs in the Add permission policies section.
7. Select or clear the Policy that you want to set in the Add permission policies section, and click NEXT.
8. Review the added information in the Review and create section.
9. Click CREATE.

The created role appears in the list available in the RBAC tab.

### User statistics

The licensed-users-info-backend plugin exposes various REST API endpoints to retrieve data related to logged-in users.

No additional configuration is required for the licensed-users-info-backend plugin. If the RBAC backend plugin is enabled, then an administrator role must be assigned to access the endpoints, as the endpoints are protected by the policy.entity.read permission.

The base URL for user statistics endpoints is http://SERVER:PORT/api/licensed-users-info, such as http://localhost:7007/api/licensed-users-info.

[GET] /users/quantity:: 
Returns the total number of logged-in users.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:7007/api/licensed-users-info/users/quantity" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
```


```json
{ "quantity": "2" }
```

# Managing authorizations by using external files

To automate Red Hat Developer Hub maintenance, you can configure permissions and roles in external files, before starting Developer Hub.

## Defining authorizations in external files by using the Operator

To automate Red Hat Developer Hub maintenance, you can define permissions and roles in external files, before starting Developer Hub.
You need to prepare your files, upload them to your OpenShift Container Platform project,
and configure Developer Hub to use the external files.

* You enabled the RBAC feature.

1. Define your policies in a rbac-policies.csv CSV file by using the following format:
1. Define role permissions:

```csv
p, <role_entity_reference>, <permission>, <action>, <allow_or_deny>
```

<role_entity_reference>:: Role entity reference, such as: role:default/guest.
<permission>:: Permission, such as: bulk.import, catalog.entity.read, or catalog.entity.refresh, or permission resource type, such as: bulk-import or catalog-entity.

See: Permission policies reference.
<action>:: Action type, such as: use, read, create, update, delete.
<allow_or_deny>:: Access granted: allow or deny.
2. Assign the role to a group or a user:

```csv
g, <group_or_user>, <role_entity_reference>
```

<group_or_user>:: Group, such as: user:default/mygroup, or user, such as: user:default/myuser.
Sample rbac-policies.csv

```csv
p, role:default/guests, catalog-entity, read, allow
p, role:default/guests, catalog.entity.create, create, allow
g, user:default/my-user, role:default/guests
g, group:default/my-group, role:default/guests
```

2. Define your conditional policies in a rbac-conditional-policies.yaml YAML file by using the following format:

```yaml
result: CONDITIONAL
roleEntityRef: <role_entity_reference>
pluginId: <plugin_id>
permissionMapping:
  - read
  - update
  - delete
conditions: <conditions>
```


See: Conditional policies reference.
3. Upload your rbac-policies.csv and rbac-conditional-policies.yaml files to a rbac-policies config map in your OpenShift Container Platform project containing Developer Hub.

```terminal
$ oc create configmap rbac-policies \
     --from-file=rbac-policies.csv \
     --from-file=rbac-conditional-policies.yaml
```

4. Update your Backstage custom resource to mount in the Developer Hub filesystem your files from the rbac-policies config map:
Backstage custom resource fragment

```yaml
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha3
kind: Backstage
spec:
  application:
    extraFiles:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
      configMaps:
        - name: rbac-policies
```

5. Update your Developer Hub app-config.yaml configuration file to use the rbac-policies.csv and rbac-conditional-policies.yaml external files:
app-config.yaml file fragment

```yaml
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    conditionalPoliciesFile: /opt/app-root/src/rbac-conditional-policies.yaml
    policies-csv-file: /opt/app-root/src/rbac-policies.csv
    policyFileReload: true
```


## Defining authorizations in external files by using Helm

To automate Red Hat Developer Hub maintenance, you can define permissions and roles in external files, before starting Developer Hub.
You need to prepare your files, upload them to your OpenShift Container Platform project,
and configure Developer Hub to use the external files.

* You enabled the RBAC feature.

1. Define your policies in a rbac-policies.csv CSV file by using the following format:
1. Define role permissions:

```csv
p, <role_entity_reference>, <permission>, <action>, <allow_or_deny>
```

<role_entity_reference>:: Role entity reference, such as: role:default/guest.
<permission>:: Permission, such as: bulk.import, catalog.entity.read, or catalog.entity.refresh, or permission resource type, such as: bulk-import or catalog-entity.

See: Permission policies reference.
<action>:: Action type, such as: use, read, create, update, delete.
<allow_or_deny>:: Access granted: allow or deny.
2. Assign the role to a group or a user:

```csv
g, <group_or_user>, <role_entity_reference>
```

<group_or_user>:: Group, such as: user:default/mygroup, or user, such as: user:default/myuser.
Sample rbac-policies.csv

```csv
p, role:default/guests, catalog-entity, read, allow
p, role:default/guests, catalog.entity.create, create, allow
g, user:default/my-user, role:default/guests
g, group:default/my-group, role:default/guests
```

2. Define your conditional policies in a rbac-conditional-policies.yaml YAML file by using the following format:

```yaml
result: CONDITIONAL
roleEntityRef: <role_entity_reference>
pluginId: <plugin_id>
permissionMapping:
  - read
  - update
  - delete
conditions: <conditions>
```


See: Conditional policies reference.
3. Upload your rbac-policies.csv and rbac-conditional-policies.yaml files to a rbac-policies config map in your OpenShift Container Platform project containing Developer Hub.

```terminal
$ oc create configmap rbac-policies \
     --from-file=rbac-policies.csv \
     --from-file=rbac-conditional-policies.yaml
```

4. Update your Developer Hub Backstage Helm chart to mount in the Developer Hub filesystem your files from the rbac-policies config map:
1. In the Developer Hub Helm Chart, go to Root Schema -> Backstage chart schema -> Backstage parameters -> Backstage container additional volume mounts.
2. Select Add Backstage container additional volume mounts and add the following values:
mountPath:: /opt/app-root/src/rbac
Name:: rbac-policies
3. Add the RBAC policy to the Backstage container additional volumes in the Developer Hub Helm Chart:
name:: rbac-policies
configMap:: 
defaultMode:: 420
name:: rbac-policies
5. Update your Developer Hub app-config.yaml configuration file to use the rbac-policies.csv and rbac-conditional-policies.yaml external files:
app-config.yaml file fragment

```yaml
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    conditionalPoliciesFile: /opt/app-root/src/rbac-conditional-policies.yaml
    policies-csv-file: /opt/app-root/src/rbac-policies.csv
    policyFileReload: true
```


# Configuring guest access with RBAC UI

Use guest access with the role-based access control (RBAC) front-end plugin to allow a user to test role and policy creation without the need to set up and configure an authentication provider.


[NOTE]
----
Guest access is not recommended for production.
----

## Configuring the RBAC backend plugin

You can configure the RBAC backend plugin by updating the app-config.yaml file to enable the permission framework.

* You have installed the @backstage-community/plugin-rbac plugin in Developer Hub. For more information, see Configuring dynamic plugins.

* Update the app-config.yaml file to enable the permission framework as shown:


```yaml
permission
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    admin:
      users:
        - name: user:default/guest
    pluginsWithPermission:
      - catalog
      - permission
      - scaffolder
```



[NOTE]
----
The pluginsWithPermission section of the app-config.yaml file includes only three plugins by default. Update the section as needed to include any additional plugins that also incorporate permissions.
----

## Setting up the guest authentication provider

You can enable guest authentication and use it alongside the RBAC frontend plugin.

* You have installed the @backstage-community/plugin-rbac plugin in Developer Hub. For more information, see Configuring dynamic plugins.

* In the app-config.yaml file, add the user entity reference to resolve and enable the dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment option, as shown in the following example:


```yaml
auth:
  environment: development
  providers:
    guest:
      userEntityRef: user:default/guest
      dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment: true
```



[NOTE]
----
You can use user:default/guest as the user entity reference to match the added user under the permission.rbac.admin.users section of the app-config.yaml file.
----

# Delegating role-based access controls (RBAC) access in Red Hat Developer Hub

An enterprise customer requires the ability to delegate role-based access control (RBAC) responsibilities to other individuals in the organization. In this scenario, you, as the administrator, can provide access to the RBAC plugin specifically to designated users, such as team leads. Each team lead is then able to manage permissions exclusively for users within their respective team or department, without visibility into or control over permissions outside their assigned scope. This approach allows team leads to manage access and permissions for their own teams independently, while administrators maintain global oversight.

In Red Hat Developer Hub, you can delegate RBAC access using the multitenancy feature of the RBAC plugin, specifically the IS_OWNER conditional rule. You can either use the web UI or the RBAC backend API, depending on your preferred workflow and level of automation:

* Use the web UI to create roles, assign users or groups, define permissions, and apply ownership conditions through an intuitive interface.
* Use the API for a more flexible and automatable approach, where you can programmatically manage roles, permissions, and ownership conditions using authenticated curl requests.

By delegating RBAC access through either method, you can expect the following outcomes:

* Team leads can manage RBAC settings for their teams independently.
* Visibility of other users' or teams' permissions is restricted.
* Administrators retain overarching control while delegating team-specific access.

* Your RHDH instance is running with the RBAC plugin installed and configured.
* You have administrative access to RHDH.

## Delegating RBAC access in Red Hat Developer Hub by using the web UI

You can delegate the RBAC access in Red Hat Developer Hub by using the web UI.

1. Log in to your RHDH instance with administrator credentials.
2. Navigate to Administration → RBAC.
3. Click Create Role and define a new role for team leads, such as role:default/team_lead.
4. In the Members section, add the user or group, such as user:default/team_lead.
5. Grant permissions required by team leads, such as:
* policy.entity.create to allow policy creation.
* catalog-entity:read to allow catalog access.
6. Apply conditions to limit access as follows:
* Use the IS_OWNER rule to ensure team leads can only manage resources they own.
7. Click Save to create the role and apply changes.

* Log in as a team lead.
* Verify the following:
* RBAC UI is accessible.
* Only users or roles related to their team are visible.
* No access to roles or permissions outside their scope is granted.

## Delegating RBAC access in Red Hat Developer Hub by using API

You can delegate the RBAC access in Red Hat Developer Hub by using the RBAC backend API.

* You have API access using curl or another tool.

1. Create a new role designated for team leads using the RBAC backend API:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/roles' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "memberReferences": ["user:default/team_lead"],
  "name": "role:default/team_lead",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "This is an example team lead role"
  }
}'
```
2. Allow team leads to read catalog entities and create permissions in the RBAC plugin using the following API request:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '[
  {
    "entityReference": "role:default/team_lead",
    "permission": "policy.entity.create",
    "policy": "create",
    "effect": "allow"
  },
  {
    "entityReference": "role:default/team_lead",
    "permission": "catalog-entity",
    "policy": "read",
    "effect": "allow"
  }
]'
```
3. To ensure team leads can only manage what they own, use the IS_OWNER conditional rule as follows:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/roles/conditions' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
 "result": "CONDITIONAL",
 "pluginId": "permission",
 "resourceType": "policy-entity",
 "conditions": {
   "rule": "IS_OWNER",
   "resourceType": "policy-entity",
   "params": {
     "owners": [
       "user:default/team_lead"
     ]
   }
 },
 "roleEntityRef": "role:default/team_lead",
 "permissionMapping": [
   "read",
   "update",
   "delete"
 ]
}'
```

The previous example of conditional policy limits visibility and control to only owned roles and policies.
4. Log in to RHDH as team lead and verify the following:
1. Use the following request and verify that you do not see any roles:
Example curl to retrieve roles visible to the team lead

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/roles' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TEAM_LEAD_TOKEN"
```

2. Use the following request to create a new role for their team:
Example curl of team lead creating a new role for their team with ownership assigned

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/roles' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TEAM_LEAD_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "memberReferences": ["user:default/team_member"],
  "name": "role:default/team_a",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "This is an example team_a role",
    "owner": "user:default/team_lead"
  }
}'
```


[NOTE]
----
You can set the ownership during creation, but you can also update the ownership at any time.
----
3. Use the following request to assign a permission policy to the new role:
Example curl for granting read access to catalog entities for the new role

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '[
  {
    "entityReference": "role:default/team_a",
    "permission": "catalog-entity",
    "policy": "read",
    "effect": "allow"
  }
]'
```

4. Use the following request to verify that only team-owned roles and policies are visible:
Example curl to retrieve roles and permission policies visible to the team lead

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/roles' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TEAM_LEAD_TOKEN"

curl -X GET 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TEAM_LEAD_TOKEN"
```

* Log in as a team lead and verify the following:
* The RBAC UI is accessible.
* Only the assigned users or group is visible.
* Permissions outside the scoped team are not viewable or editable.
* Log in as an administrator and verify that you retain full visibility and control.

# Permission policies reference

Permission policies in Red Hat Developer Hub are a set of rules to govern access to resources or functionalities. These policies state the authorization level that is granted to users based on their roles. The permission policies are implemented to maintain security and confidentiality within a given environment.

You can define the following types of permissions in Developer Hub:

* resource type
* basic

The distinction between the two permission types depends on whether a permission includes a defined resource type.

You can define the resource type permission using either the associated resource type or the permission name as shown in the following example:


```csv
p, role:default/myrole, catalog.entity.read, read, allow
g, user:default/myuser, role:default/myrole

p, role:default/another-role, catalog-entity, read, allow
g, user:default/another-user, role:default/another-role
```


You can define the basic permission in Developer Hub using the permission name as shown in the following example:


```csv
p, role:default/myrole, catalog.entity.create, create, allow
g, user:default/myuser, role:default/myrole
```


Developer Hub supports following permission policies:

Catalog permissions:: 



Bulk import permission:: 



Scaffolder permissions:: 



RBAC permissions:: 



Kubernetes permissions:: 



OCM permissions:: Basic OCM permissions only restrict access to the cluster view, but they do not prevent access to the Kubernetes clusters in the resource view. For more effective permissions, consider applying a conditional policy to restrict access to catalog entities that are of type kubernetes-cluster. Access restriction is dependent on the set of permissions granted to a role. For example, if the role had full permissions (read, update, and delete), then you must specify all its permissions in the permissionMapping field.


```csv
result: CONDITIONAL
roleEntityRef: 'role:default/<YOUR_ROLE>'
pluginId: catalog
resourceType: catalog-entity
permissionMapping:
  - read
  - update
  - delete
conditions:
  not:
    rule: HAS_SPEC
    resourceType: catalog-entity
    params:
      key: type
      value: kubernetes-cluster
```




Topology permissions:: 



Tekton permissions:: 



ArgoCD permissions:: 



Quay permissions:: 



# Conditional policies in Red Hat Developer Hub

The permission framework in Red Hat Developer Hub provides conditions, supported by the RBAC backend plugin (backstage-plugin-rbac-backend). The conditions work as content filters for the Developer Hub resources that are provided by the RBAC backend plugin.

The RBAC backend API stores conditions assigned to roles in the database. When you request to access the frontend resources, the RBAC backend API searches for the corresponding conditions and delegates them to the appropriate plugin using its plugin ID. If you are assigned to multiple roles with different conditions, then the RBAC backend merges the conditions using the anyOf criteria.

Conditional criteria:: 
A condition in Developer Hub is a simple condition with a rule and parameters. However, a condition can also contain a parameter or an array of parameters combined by conditional criteria. The supported conditional criteria includes:
* allOf: Ensures that all conditions within the array must be true for the combined condition to be satisfied.
* anyOf: Ensures that at least one of the conditions within the array must be true for the combined condition to be satisfied.
* not: Ensures that the condition within it must not be true for the combined condition to be satisfied.
Conditional object:: 

The plugin specifies the parameters supported for conditions. You can access the conditional object schema from the RBAC API endpoint to understand how to construct a conditional JSON object, which is then used by the RBAC backend plugin API.

A conditional object contains the following parameters:

Conditional policy aliases:: 

The RBAC backend plugin (backstage-plugin-rbac-backend) supports the use of aliases in conditional policy rule parameters. The conditional policy aliases are dynamically replaced with the corresponding values during policy evaluation. Each alias in conditional policy is prefixed with a $ sign indicating its special function.

The supported conditional aliases include:
* $currentUser: This alias is replaced with the user entity reference for the user who requests access to the resource. For example, if user Tom from the default namespace requests access, $currentUser becomes user:default/tom.

Example conditional policy object with $currentUser alias:

```json
{
  "result": "CONDITIONAL",
  "roleEntityRef": "role:default/developer",
  "pluginId": "catalog",
  "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
  "permissionMapping": ["delete"],
  "conditions": {
    "rule": "IS_ENTITY_OWNER",
    "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
    "params": {
      "claims": ["$currentUser"]
    }
  }
}
```

* $ownerRefs: This alias is replaced with ownership references, usually as an array that includes the user entity reference and the user's parent group entity reference. For example, for user Tom from team-a, $ownerRefs becomes ['user:default/tom', 'group:default/team-a'].

Example conditional policy object with $ownerRefs alias:

```json
{
  "result": "CONDITIONAL",
  "roleEntityRef": "role:default/developer",
  "pluginId": "catalog",
  "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
  "permissionMapping": ["delete"],
  "conditions": {
    "rule": "IS_ENTITY_OWNER",
    "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
    "params": {
      "claims": ["$ownerRefs"]
    }
  }
}
```


## Enabling transitive parent groups

By default, Red Hat Developer Hub does not resolve indirect parent groups during authentication.
In this case, with the following group hierarchy, the user_alice user is only a member of the group_developers group:


```
group_admin
  └── group_developers
    └── user_alice
```


To support multi-level group hierarchies when using the $ownerRefs alias, you can configure Developer Hub to include indirect parent groups in the user’s ownership entities.
In that case the user_alice user is a member of both group_developers and group_admin groups.

* Enable the includeTransitiveGroupOwnership option in your app-config.yaml file.

```yaml
includeTransitiveGroupOwnership: true
```


## Conditional policies reference

You can access API endpoints for conditional policies in Red Hat Developer Hub. For example, to retrieve the available conditional rules, which can help you define these policies, you can access the GET [api/plugins/condition-rules] endpoint.

The api/plugins/condition-rules returns the condition parameters schemas, for example:


```json

      "pluginId": "catalog",
      "rules": [

```


The RBAC backend API constructs a condition JSON object based on the previous condition schema.

### Examples of conditional policies

In Red Hat Developer Hub, you can define conditional policies with or without criteria. You can use the following examples to define the conditions based on your use case:

A condition without criteria:: 
Consider a condition without criteria displaying catalogs only if user is a member of the owner group. To add this condition, you can use the catalog plugin schema IS_ENTITY_OWNER as follows:

```json
{
  "rule": "IS_ENTITY_OWNER",
  "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
  "params": {
    "claims": ["group:default/team-a"]
  }
}
```

In the previous example, the only conditional parameter used is claims, which contains a list of user or group entity references.
You can apply the previous example condition to the RBAC REST API by adding additional parameters as follows:

```json
{
  "result": "CONDITIONAL",
  "roleEntityRef": "role:default/test",
  "pluginId": "catalog",
  "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
  "permissionMapping": ["read"],
  "conditions": {
    "rule": "IS_ENTITY_OWNER",
    "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
    "params": {
      "claims": ["group:default/team-a"]
    }
  }
}
```
A condition with criteria:: 
Consider a condition with criteria, which displays catalogs only if user is a member of owner group OR displays list of all catalog user groups.
To add the criteria, you can add another rule as IS_ENTITY_KIND in the condition as follows:

```json
{
  "anyOf": [
    {
      "rule": "IS_ENTITY_OWNER",
      "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
      "params": {
        "claims": ["group:default/team-a"]
      }
    },
    {
      "rule": "IS_ENTITY_KIND",
      "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
      "params": {
        "kinds": ["Group"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


[NOTE]
----
Running conditions in parallel during creation is not supported. Therefore, consider defining nested conditional policies based on the available criteria.
----

```json
{
  "anyOf": [
    {
      "rule": "IS_ENTITY_OWNER",
      "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
      "params": {
        "claims": ["group:default/team-a"]
      }
    },
    {
      "rule": "IS_ENTITY_KIND",
      "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
      "params": {
        "kinds": ["Group"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "not": {
    "rule": "IS_ENTITY_KIND",
    "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
    "params": { "kinds": ["Api"] }
  }
}
```

You can apply the previous example condition to the RBAC REST API by adding additional parameters as follows:

```json
{
  "result": "CONDITIONAL",
  "roleEntityRef": "role:default/test",
  "pluginId": "catalog",
  "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
  "permissionMapping": ["read"],
  "conditions": {
    "anyOf": [
      {
        "rule": "IS_ENTITY_OWNER",
        "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
        "params": {
          "claims": ["group:default/team-a"]
        }
      },
      {
        "rule": "IS_ENTITY_KIND",
        "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
        "params": {
          "kinds": ["Group"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following examples can be used with Developer Hub plugins. These examples can help you determine how to define conditional policies:


```json
{
  "result": "CONDITIONAL",
  "roleEntityRef": "role:default/developer",
  "pluginId": "catalog",
  "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
  "permissionMapping": ["update", "delete"],
  "conditions": {
    "not": {
      "rule": "HAS_ANNOTATION",
      "resourceType": "catalog-entity",
      "params": { "annotation": "keycloak.org/realm", "value": "<YOUR_REALM>" }
    }
  }
}
```


The previous example of Keycloak plugin prevents users in the role:default/developer from updating or deleting users that are ingested into the catalog from the Keycloak plugin.


[NOTE]
----
In the previous example, the annotation keycloak.org/realm requires the value of <YOUR_REALM>.
----


```json
{
  "result": "CONDITIONAL",
  "roleEntityRef": "role:default/developer",
  "pluginId": "scaffolder",
  "resourceType": "scaffolder-action",
  "permissionMapping": ["use"],
  "conditions": {
    "not": {
      "rule": "HAS_ACTION_ID",
      "resourceType": "scaffolder-action",
      "params": { "actionId": "quay:create-repository" }
    }
  }
}
```


The previous example of Quay plugin prevents the role role:default/developer from using the Quay scaffolder action. Note that permissionMapping contains use, signifying that scaffolder-action resource type permission does not have a permission policy.
