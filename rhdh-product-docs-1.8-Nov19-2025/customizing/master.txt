```


# About Software Templates

Software Templates in Red Hat Developer Hub provide a streamlined way to create software components and publish them to different version control repositories such as Git.
Platform engineers create and maintain Software Templates in Red Hat Developer Hub.

## Versioning a Software Template in Red Hat Developer Hub

As a platform administrator, you can version Software Templates by using the existing custom actions catalog:scaffolded-from and catalog:template:version within the scaffolder backend module. By using these custom actions, you can track the scaffolder template version and the corresponding version of the entities created from it, which improves lifecycle management.

* You have administrator rights to Red Hat Developer Hub.

To add versioning to a Software Template yaml file, complete the following steps:

1. Modify the Software Template that you want to update.
2. Complete one or both of the following tasks:
* Include the backstage.io/template-version annotation in your template. When this annotation is present in your template, it is automatically used to annotate your catalog entity and a default version value is displayed.
* Pass the backstage.io/template-version annotation as input to the action. This method takes precedence over the annotation in the template itself. It allows the user running the template to specify the version they wish to generate.

```yaml
# ...
- id: version-templateRef
  name: Append the version of this template to the entityRef
  action: catalog:template:version
  input:
    annotations:
      backstage.io/template-version: ${{ parameters.version }}
# ...
```


1. Create a catalog component using the updated Software Template. This step creates a new component in Backstage and optionally, pushes files to an external repository (For example, GitHub, GitLab).
2. Check the component in the Catalog UI.
1. On the Catalog page, locate the newly created catalog component.
2. Verify that the backstage.io/template-version annotation is present in the entity. You can use INSPECT ENTITY and select YAML Raw or JSON Raw view to find the annotation in the component definition.
3. Only if you have published the catalog component: Check the component file in the repository.
1. If VIEW SOURCE is present in your UI: Click VIEW SOURCE to open the stored component file in the repository.
2. Locate the file manually and verify that the backstage.io/template-version annotation is present.

## Enabling Software Template version update notifications in Red Hat Developer Hub

As a platform engineer, you can enable notification alerts for template version updates using the @backstage-community/plugin-catalog-backend-module-scaffolder-relation-processor module, an extension to the catalog-backend plugin. When enabled, this module automatically notifies component owners whenever the Software Template used to generate their components is updated to a new version.

This functionality uses the spec.scaffoldedFrom field in catalog entities. This field links Software Templates to the entities they have scaffolded. By tracking this relationship, the module helps teams stay informed and take advantage of the latest improvements or fixes.

The plugin-catalog-backend-module-scaffolder-relation-processor module is disabled by default.

* You have installed and configured the Backstage backend notification plugin @backstage/plugin-notifications-backend.
* You have installed and configured the Backstage frontend plugin @backstage/plugin-notifications.

1. To enable the notifications, in your Red Hat Developer Hub app-config.yaml file, add the following codes:
1. In the dynamicPlugins:frontend section:

```yaml
frontend:
  backstage.plugin-notifications:
    dynamicRoutes:
      - importName: NotificationPage
	      menuItem:
	        config:
	          props:
              titleCounterEnabled: true
		          webNotificationsEnabled: false
	        importName: NotificationsSidebarItem
	        path: /notifications
```

2. In a new section:

```yaml
scaffolder:
  notifications:
    templateUpdate:
      enabled: true # Set to false to disable notifications
```


You can also customize the notification title and description as shown in the following code:

```yaml
scaffolder:
  notifications:
    templateUpdate:
      enabled: true
      message:
        title: 'Custom title for $ENTITY_DISPLAY_NAME'
        description: 'Custom description'
```


where:
enabled:: Set to true to enable the notification. Default value is false.
message:title:: Enter the notification title.
message:description:: Enter the notification description.


[NOTE]
----
Both message:title and message:description support the template variable $ENTITY_DISPLAY_NAME. The system automatically substitutes this variable with the title (or the name, if the title is missing) of the entity scaffolded from the updated template.
----

* In your Red Hat Developer Hub instance, on the left navigation menu, you are able to see Notifications, or, if configured, the custom title.
* When you update the version number in the Software Template, you receive a notification.

## Tracking Component origin and Software Template version

Platform engineers use custom actions within the Software Template scaffolding process to establish and track the dependency link between a generated entity (Component or Resource) and its source template. This relationship is called scaffolding provenance.

Platform administrators use custom actions such as catalog:scaffolded-from and catalog:template:version in the scaffolder backend module to track the template version and the corresponding entity version, which simplifies lifecycle management.

### Configuring provenance and Software Template versioning Red Hat Developer Hub

As a platform engineer, you must modify the Software Template YAML definition to ensure the required provenance information is added during the scaffolding process.

* You have administrator rights to Red Hat Developer Hub.

1. Locate the Software Template object YAML file where you want to add the provenance information and add a step that uses the catalog:scaffolded-from action. This action links the resulting catalog entity back to the source template.
2. Optional: To track the template version (for example, v1.0 versus v1.5), include the catalog:template:version action in the steps section. The following code block is an example to adding versioning action to the steps section:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: create-provenance-annotation
    name: Append the entityRef of this template to the entityRef
    action: catalog:scaffolded-from
  - id: create-version-annotation
    name: Create Template Version Annotation
    action: catalog:template:version
    input:
      templateVersion: ${{ parameters.version }}
  - ... other steps ...
```


where:
steps:input:templateVersion:: Reads the version parameter

[NOTE]
----
The catalog:template:version action reads a version parameter defined in the template and applies it as an annotation to the resulting catalog entity.
----
3. In your Red Hat Developer Hub app-config.yaml file, configure the catalog.locations section to point to the Software Template that you want to add. You might need to add Template to the global catalog.rules.allow list or add a granular rule to the location to allow for Software Templates ingestion, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
# ...
catalog:
  locations:
    - type: url
      target: https://<repository_url>/example-template.yaml
      rules:
        - allow: [Template]
# ...
```


where:
catalog.locations.type:: Enter the url type if you are importing templates from a repository, such as GitHub or GitLab.
catalog.locations.target:: Enter the URL for the template.
catalog.locations.rules.allow:: Enter the Template rule to allow new Software Templates to be added to the catalog.

After creating a component with the updated template, verify the provenance annotations in the resulting Catalog Entity YAML.

1. In the Red Hat Developer Hub navigation menu, go to Catalog and locate the newly created catalog component.
2. To view the underlying data that links the entity to the template, select the INSPECT ENTITY option.
3. To verify provenance annotations, complete the following steps:
1. Select the YAML Raw or JSON Raw view and verify the presence of the data item for the scaffoldedFrom link.
2. Optional: If versioning was included, verify the presence of the backstage.io/template-version annotation.

[NOTE]
----
If you publish the catalog component to an external repository (such as Git), the component file in that repository must also contain the backstage.io/template-version annotation.
----

### Viewing Software Template dependencies

As a developer, you can track which entities were created from a specific Software Template. When a platform engineer configures provenance on a template, you can quickly identify the complete dependency and impact map of that template by viewing all linked components and resources in the Catalog.

To view all components created from a specific template, complete the following steps:

1. In the Red Hat Developer Hub navigation menu, click Catalog, use the filters to find and select the Software Template you wish to inspect.
2. In the Software Template detail page, click the Dependencies tab. This view lists all catalog entities such as components, resources, and systems that reference this template, including any version information if configured.

# Customizing the Learning Paths in Red Hat Developer Hub

In Red Hat Developer Hub, you can configure Learning Paths by hosting the required data externally,
and using the built-in proxy to deliver this data rather than the default.

You can provide Learning Paths data from the following sources:

* A JSON file hosted on a web server, such as GitHub or GitLab.
* A dedicated service that provides the Learning Paths data in JSON format using an API.

## About Learning Paths

You can use the Learning Paths plugin in Red Hat Developer Hub to integrate customized e-learning content into the developer workflows. By using Learning Paths, you can create a collaborative learning culture, boost productivity, and ensure that teams stay updated with relevant best practices and technologies. The overall purpose is to accelerate onboarding, address skill gaps, ensure regulatory compliance, promote best practices, and facilitate product updates.

## Customizing the Learning Paths by using a hosted JSON file

For ease of use and simplicity, you can configure the Learning Paths by using a hosted JSON file.

1. Publish the JSON file containing your Learning Paths data to a web server, such as GitHub or Gitlab.
You can find an example at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/rhdh/release-1.8/packages/app/public/learning-paths/data.json.
2. Configure the Developer Hub proxy to access the Learning Paths data from the hosted JSON file, by adding the following to the app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
proxy:
  endpoints:
    '/developer-hub':
      target: <target>
      pathRewrite:
        '^/api/proxy/developer-hub/learning-paths': '<learning_path.json>'
      changeOrigin: true
      secure: true
```

<target>:: Enter the hosted JSON file base URL, such as https://raw.githubusercontent.com.
<learning_path.json>:: Enter the hosted JSON file path without the base URL, such as '/redhat-developer/rhdh/main/packages/app/public/learning-paths/data.json'

[TIP]
----
When also configuring the home page, due to the use of overlapping pathRewrites for both the learning-path and homepage quick access proxies, create the learning-paths configuration (^api/proxy/developer-hub/learning-paths) before you create the homepage configuration (^/api/proxy/developer-hub).
For example:

```yaml
proxy:
  endpoints:
    '/developer-hub':
      target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
      pathRewrite:
        '^/api/proxy/developer-hub/learning-paths': '/redhat-developer/rhdh/main/packages/app/public/learning-paths/data.json'
        '^/api/proxy/developer-hub/tech-radar': '/redhat-developer/rhdh/main/packages/app/public/tech-radar/data-default.json'
        '^/api/proxy/developer-hub': '/redhat-developer/rhdh/main/packages/app/public/homepage/data.json'
      changeOrigin: true
      secure: true
```

----

* Customizing the Home page in Red Hat Developer Hub

## Customizing the Learning Paths by using a customization service

For advanced scenarios, you can host your Red Hat Developer Hub customization service to provide data to all configurable Developer Hub pages, such as the Learning Paths.
You can even use a different service for each page.

1. Deploy your Developer Hub customization service on the same OpenShift Container Platform cluster as your Developer Hub instance.
You can find an example at red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider, that provides the same data as default Developer Hub data.
The customization service provides a Learning Paths data URL such as: http://<rhdh-customization-provider>/learning-paths.
2. Configure the  Developer Hub proxy to use your dedicated service to provide the Learning Path data, add the following to the app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
proxy:
  endpoints:
    '/developer-hub/learning-paths':
      target: <learning_path_data_url>
      changeOrigin: true
      qsecure: true 1
```

Change to "false" in case of using self hosted cluster with a self-signed certificate

## Starting and completing lessons in Learning Paths

As a developer, you can start a course and complete the lessons at your own pace.

1. You can log in to developers.redhat.com
2. Your platform engineer has granted you access to the Learning Paths plugin.

To start a course in Learning Paths, complete the following steps:

1. In your Red Hat Developer Hub navigation menu, click Learning Paths.
2. Select the tile for the course you would like to begin.

[NOTE]
----
This action redirects you to the main page of the course in the Red Hat Developers site.

                config:
                  priority: 10
```


where:

search:: Enter false to hide the Search modal in the sidebar menu.
Enter true to display the Search modal in the sidebar menu.
settings:: Enter false to hides the Settings button in the sidebar menu.
Enter true to display the Settings button in the sidebar menu.
default.main-menu-items:: Enter this field to hide the Self-service button from the sidebar menu.
Remove this field to display the Self-service button in the sidebar menu.
position:: Enter above-main-content to position the header above the main content.
Enter above-sidebar to position the header above the sidebar.

To extend the functionality of the default global header, include any of the following attributes in your global header entry:

mountPoint:: Specifies the location of the header. Use application/header to specify it as a global header. You can configure several global headers at different positions by adding entries to the mountPoints field.
importName:: Specifies the component exported by the global header plugin.

The red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-global-header package (enabled by default) offers the following header components as possible mount point values:
* SearchComponent: Adds a search bar (enabled by default).
* Spacer: Adds spacing in the header to position buttons at the end. Useful when you disable SearchComponent.
* HeaderIconButton: Adds an icon button. By default, the Self-service icon button remains enabled.
* SupportButton: Adds a Support icon button, allowing users to configure a link to an internal or external page. Enabled by default but requires additional configuration to display.
* NotificationButton: Adds a Notifications icon button to display unread notifications in real time and navigate to the Notifications page. Enabled by default (requires the notifications plugin).
* Divider: Adds a vertical divider. By default, a divider appears between the profile dropdown and other header components.
* ProfileDropdown: Adds a profile dropdown showing the logged-in user's name. By default, it contains two menu items.
* MenuItemLink: Adds a link item in a dropdown menu. By default, the profile dropdown includes a link to the Settings page.
* LogoutButton: Adds a logout button in the profile dropdown (enabled by default).
* CreateDropdown: Adds a Self-service dropdown button (disabled by default). The menu items are configurable.
* SoftwareTemplatesSection: Adds a list of software template links to the Self-service dropdown menu (disabled by default). You must enable CreateDropdown.
* RegisterAComponentSection: Adds a link to the Register a Component page in the Self-service dropdown menu (disabled by default). You must enable CreateDropdown.
config.position:: Specifies the position of the header. Supported values are above-main-content and above-sidebar.

* You must configure the support URL in the app-config.yaml file to display the Support button in the header.
* You must install the notifications plugin to display the Notifications button in the header.

1. Copy the default configuration and modify the field values to suit your needs. You can adjust the priority value of each header component to control its position. Additionally, you can enable or disable components by adding or removing them from the configuration. To ensure that the remaining header buttons align with the end of the header before the profile dropdown button, set config.props.growFactor to 1 in the Spacer mount point to enable the Spacer component. For example:

```yaml
- mountPoint: global.header/component
  importName: Spacer
  config:
    priority: 100
    props:
      growFactor: 1
```

2. To use your custom header, you must install it as a dynamic plugin by adding your plugin configuration to your app-config-dynamic.yaml file. For example:

```yaml
- package: <npm_or_oci_package-reference>
  disabled: false
  pluginConfig:
    dynamicPlugins:
      frontend:
        <package_name>:
          mountPoints:
            - mountPoint: application/header
              importName: <application_header_name>
              config:
                position: above-main-content
            - mountPoint: global.header/component
              importName: <header_component_name>
              config:
                priority: 100
            - mountPoint: global.header/component
              importName: <header_component_name>
              config:
                priority: 90
```


where:
<npm_or_oci_package-reference>:: Specifies the package name.
<application_header_name>:: Specifies the name of the application header. For example: MyHeader
<header_component_name>:: Specifies the name of the header component. For example: MyHeaderComponent

[NOTE]
----
importName is an optional name referencing the value returned by the scaffolder field extension API.
----
3. Optional: To disable the global header, set the value of the disabled field to true in your dynamic-plugins.yaml file. For example:

```yaml
- package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-global-header
  disabled: true
```


## Mount points for dynamic plugin integration

You can customize the application header in Developer Hub using mount points for dynamic plugins. These mount points give flexibility in configuring the position of the header, its components and dropdown menus. You can create a customized experience with the following enhancements:

application/header:: Controls the header position. Use config.position to set placement as either above-main-content or above-sidebar.
global.header/component:: Configures header components. Use config.priority to set the order of components, and pass properties (including CSS styles) via config.props.
Self-service button:: 

```yaml
- mountPoint: global.header/component
  importName: HeaderIconButton
  config:
    priority: 80
    props:
      title: Self-service
      icon: add
      to: create
```

Spacer element:: 

```yaml
- mountPoint: global.header/component
  importName: Spacer
  config:
    priority: 99
    props:
      growFactor: 0
```

Divider element:: 

```yaml
mountPoints:
  - mountPoint: global.header/component
    importName: Divider
    config:
      priority: 150
```

global.header/profile:: Configures the profile dropdown list when the ProfileDropdown component is enabled.
* To add a settings link to the profile dropdown, use the following code:

```yaml
- mountPoint: global.header/profile
  importName: MenuItemLink
  config:
    priority: 100
    props:
      title: Settings
      link: /settings
      icon: manageAccounts
```

global.header/create:: Configures the create dropdown list when the CreateDropdown component is enabled.
* To add a section for registering a component, use the following code:

```yaml
- mountPoint: global.header/create
  importName: RegisterAComponentSection
  config:
    props:
      growFactor: 0
```


## Configuring the logo in the global header

You can configure a company logo in the global header of the Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) to reflect your company&#8217;s branding. CompanyLogo is part of the global header by default and offers full control over the theming, navigation behavior, sizing, and fallback options.

This component supports the following props, which are provided through configuration:

* logo: The base64 encoded logo image.
* to: The redirect path for when users click the logo is '/catalog'.
* width: The logo width is optional and defaults to 150 px.
* height: The logo height is optional and defaults to 40 px.

1. To display a custom company logo in the global header, update the configuration with a mount point for CompanyLogo:

```yaml
# ...rest of the global header configuration
red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-global-header:
  mountPoints:
    - mountPoint: application/header
      importName: GlobalHeader
      config:
        # Supported values: above-main-content | above-sidebar
        position: above-main-content

    - mountPoint: global.header/component
      importName: CompanyLogo
      config:
        priority: 200
        props:
          # Path to navigate when users click the logo:
          to: '/catalog'
          width: 300
          height: 200
          logo: <string> or <object> # Logo can be a base64 string or theme-specific object
            # Example 1: Single logo for all themes
            # logo: "<base64_encoded_images>"

            # Example 2: Theme-specific logos
            # logo:
                dark: 'data:image/png;base64,...' # Used in dark theme
                light: 'data:image/png;base64,...' # Used in light theme
```

2. (Optional) If you do not provide logo props to the CompanyLogo component, the component instead uses values defined under app.branding in your app-config.yaml file. You can configure the CompanyLogo as shown in the following configuration:

```yaml
app:
  branding:
    fullLogoWidth: 220  # Fallback width
    fullLogo: <string> or <object> #fullLogo can be a base64 string or theme-specific object

    # Example 1: Single logo for all themes
    #fullLogo: "<base64_encoded_image>
    # Example 2: Theme-specific logos
    #fullLogo:
        dark: 'data:image/png;base64,...' # Used in dark theme
        light: 'data:image/png;base64,...' # Used in light theme
```


CompanyLogo uses the following configuration elements to control fallback and sizing behavior:
* Logo source priority
* The component selects the logo source in the following order:

First, CompanyLogo props (logo, logo.light, logo.dark), then, app.branding.fullLogo. If you do not provide a logo through either, the component displays the default Developer Hub theme-specific logo.
* Logo width priority
* The component applies the first available value from props.width, then app.branding.fullLogoWidth from app-config.yaml. If you do not specify the width using either, the component applies a default width (150 px).


[NOTE]
----
CompanyLogo preserves the images aspect ratio and never crops or distorts it. If the configured width results in a height greater than the maximum allowed (default: 40px), the image is automatically scaled down. As a result, adjusting only the width may not visibly change the logo unless the height is also configured.
Increasing the logo height increases the height of the global header. The component first applies the value from props.height. If you do not specify the height, the component applies a default height (40px).
----

1. The logo appears correctly in the global header.
2. Click the logo to confirm it redirects to the path you defined in props.to.
3. Toggle between light and dark themes to ensure the correct logo loads in each.
4. (Optional) Temporarily remove the CompanyLogo props to test the fallback to app.branding.fullLogo.

## Enabling logo in the sidebar

You can configure a logo in the sidebar of the Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH).

1. To display the logo exclusively in the sidebar, set the value of the app.sidebar.logo parameter to true as shown in the following example:

```yaml
app:
  sidebar:
    logo: true
```


[NOTE]
----
To display the logo in only the sidebar, remove the CompanyLogo component from the configuration.
----
2. To display the same logo in the sidebar for all themes, update the configuration as shown in the following configuration:

```yaml
app:
  sidebar:
    logo: true
  branding:
    fullLogoWidth: 220
    fullLogo: 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,...'
```

3. For theme-specific logos, you can configure the sidebar logo as shown in the following configuration:

```yaml
app:
  sidebar:
    logo: true
  branding:
    fullLogoWidth: 220
    fullLogo:
      light: 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,...'
      dark: 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,...'
```


1. The logo appears correctly in the sidebar.
2. Toggle between light and dark themes to ensure the correct logo loads in each.

## Displaying the preferred username in the profile dropdown

You can display the preferred username in the global header profile drop-down list by configuring spec.profile.displayName in the user entity. When not configured, the application falls back to a metadata.title. If neither is configured, it defaults to a user-friendly name generated by the useProfileInfo hook.

1. To configure spec.profile.displayName, use the following code:

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: User
metadata:
  # Required unique username
  name: <my_display_name>
  # Optional preferred title
  title: <display_name_title>
spec:
  profile:
    # Optional preferred display name (highest priority)
    displayName: <my_display_name>
  memberOf: [janus-authors]
```

2. To configure metadata.title rather than spec.profile.displayname, use the following code:

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: User
metadata:
  # Required unique username
  name: <my_display_name>
  # Optional preferred title
  title: <display_name_title>
spec:
  memberOf: [janus-authors]
```

3. To configure neither spec.profile.displayname or metadata.title, use the following code:

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: User
metadata:
  # Required unique username
  name: <my_display_name>
spec:
  memberOf: [janus-authors]
```



[NOTE]
----
The application falls back to metadata.name when you do not register the user entity.
----

## Quicklinks and Starred Items in the global header

The Quicklinks matrix and Starred Items drop-down list are enabled by default and appear in the global header without requiring additional configuration.

The Quicklinks matrix, organized by sections (for example, Documentation or Developer Tools), allows users to quickly access internal or external resources. The Starred Items drop-down list contains entities and pages that the user has starred.

The default configuration includes the following components:

StarredDropdown:: Display the Starred Items menu in the global header by default, as shown in the following configuration:

```yaml
# Group: Global Header
- package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-global-header
  - mountPoint: global.header/component
    importName: StarredDropdown
    config:
      priority: 85
```

ApplicationLauncherDropdown:: Provide the Quicklinks matrix (application launcher) by default, as shown in the following configuration:

```yaml
# Group: Global Header
- package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-global-header
  - mountPoint: global.header/component
    importName: ApplicationLauncherDropdown
    config:
      priority: 82
```

MenuItemLink entries:: Define sections, titles, icons, and links within the Quicklinks matrix. The default configuration includes links to the Developer Hub documentation and an RHDH Local, as shown in the following configurations:

```yaml
- mountPoint: global.header/application-launcher
  importName: MenuItemLink
  config:
    section: Documentation
    priority: 150
    props:
      title: Developer Hub
      icon: developerHub
      link: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub

- mountPoint: global.header/application-launcher
  importName: MenuItemLink
  config:
    section: Developer Tools
    priority: 100
    props:
      title: RHDH Local
      icon: developerHub
      link: https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-local
```



[NOTE]
----
When upgrading from previous versions, the installer does not overwrite your existing dynamic-plugins.yaml configuration. If you had not configured Starred Items or Quicklinks previously, they remain disabled after the upgrade and must be manually enabled.
----

## Enabling Quicklinks and Starred Items after an upgrade

If you upgrade from Red Hat Developer Hub 1.6 or earlier, Red Hat Developer Hub does not automatically enable the Quicklinks and Starred Items features. You must manually configure these features to display them in the global header.

1. You have access to your Red Hat Developer Hub configuration files.
2. You have administrative permissions to modify ConfigMaps (if using the Operator).

1. Locate your dynamic-plugin configuration.
* Operator deployment: The configuration is stored in a ConfigMap referenced by your Backstage custom resource (CR).
* Helm deployment: The configuration is in your values.yaml file or separate configuration files.
2. Enable the global header plugin. Ensure that the red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-global-header entry exists under the plugins: list and that disabled is set to false.
3. Verify that you enabled the global header plugin.
Confirm that you listed the red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-global-header plugin under plugins: with disabled: false (or without a disabled property):

```yaml
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-global-header
    disabled: false
```

4. Add the required components. Under the mountPoints section of the plugin, add the components as shown in the following example:

```yaml
  mountPoints:
    - mountPoint: application/header
      importName: GlobalHeader
      config:
        position: above-sidebar
    - mountPoint: global.header/component
      importName: StarredDropdown
      config:
        priority: 85
    - mountPoint: global.header/component
      importName: ApplicationLauncherDropdown
      config:
        priority: 82
    - mountPoint: global.header/component
      importName: MenuItemLink
      config:
        section: Documentation
      priority: 150
      props:
          title: Developer Hub
          icon: developerHub
          link: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub
    - mountPoint: global.header/application-launcher
    importName: MenuItemLink
    config:
      section: Developer Tools
      priority: 100
      props:
          title: RHDH Local
          icon: developerHub
          link: https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-local
```

5. Apply the configuration.
* Operator deployment: Update the ConfigMap and allow the Operator to reconcile the changes.
* Helm deployment: Apply your updated configuration using helm upgrade.
6. Verify the features are enabled.
After the Red Hat Developer Hub instance restarts, confirm that the star icon and Quicklinks matrix appear in the global header.

# Configuring a floating action button in Red Hat Developer Hub

You can use the floating action button plugin to configure any action as a floating button in the Developer Hub instance. The floating action button plugin is enabled by default. You can also configure floating action buttons to display as submenu options within the main floating action button by assigning the floating action buttons to the same slot field of your dynamic-plugins.yaml file.

## Configuring a floating action button as a dynamic plugin

You can configure the floating action button as a dynamic plugin to perform actions or open an internal or external link.

* You must have sufficient permissions as a platform engineer.

To configure a floating action button as a dynamic plugin, complete any of the following tasks:

* Specify the global.floatingactionbutton/config mount point in your app-config-dynamic.yaml file. For example:

```yaml
- package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-bulk-import
  disabled: false
  pluginConfig:
    dynamicPlugins:
      frontend:

```

frontend:mountPoints:importName:: Enter the import name with an associated component to the mount point.

## Translation support

The Global Floating Action Button plugin supports internationalization (i18n) through translation keys. You can use labelKey and toolTipKey properties to provide translation keys instead of static text.

Example for using translation keys in dynamic configuration:


```yaml
- package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-global-floating-action-button
  disabled: false
  pluginConfig:
    dynamicPlugins:
      frontend:
        red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-global-floating-action-button:
          translationResources:
            - importName: globalFloatingActionButtonTranslations
              ref: globalFloatingActionButtonTranslationRef
          mountPoints:
            - mountPoint: application/listener
              importName: DynamicGlobalFloatingActionButton
            - mountPoint: global.floatingactionbutton/config
              importName: NullComponent
              config:
                icon: github
                label: 'GitHub' # Fallback text
                labelKey: 'fab.github.label' # Translation key
                toolTip: 'GitHub Repository' # Fallback text
                toolTipKey: 'fab.github.tooltip' # Translation key
                to: https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugins
            - mountPoint: global.floatingactionbutton/config
              importName: NullComponent
              config:
                color: 'success'
                icon: search
                label: 'Create' # Fallback text
                labelKey: 'fab.create.label' # Translation key
                toolTip: 'Create entity' # Fallback text
                toolTipKey: 'fab.create.tooltip' # Translation key
                to: '/create'
                showLabel: true
```


## Enabling floating action button localization in RHDH

You can enable translation key support for floating action buttons, so that users can onboard in their preferred language. In Developer Hub, all existing and newly created floating action buttons support localization using dedicated translation keys.

The Global Floating Action Button plugin supports internationalization (i18n) through translation keys. You can use labelKey and toolTipKey properties to provide translation keys instead of static text.

The plugin provides the following built-in translation keys organized under the fab namespace:

* fab.create.label - "Create"
* fab.create.tooltip - "Create entity"
* fab.docs.label - "Docs"
* fab.docs.tooltip - "Documentation"
* fab.apis.label - "APIs"
* fab.apis.tooltip - "API Documentation"
* fab.github.label - "GitHub"
* fab.github.tooltip - "GitHub Repository"
* fab.bulkImport.label - "Bulk Import"
* fab.bulkImport.tooltip - "Register multiple repositories in bulk"
* fab.quay.label - "Quay"
* fab.quay.tooltip - "Quay Container Registry"

The plugin includes translations for the following supported languages:

* English (default)
* French (fr)

To ensure backward compatibility while providing translation support when available, the following order is used to resolve string translations:

1. If the labelKey is provided, the plugin will attempt to resolve the translation key
2. If the translation key is found, it will be used as the label
3. If the translation key is not found, the plugin will fall back to the label property


[NOTE]
----
The same logic applies to toolTipKey and toolTip.
----

### Internal translation implementation

The plugin uses a centralized translation system where:

* The useTranslation() hook is called in components that render floating action buttons to ensure proper translation context initialization
* The translation function (t) is passed down to child components that need to resolve translation keys
* This internal architecture prevents infinite re-render loops and ensures stable component rendering
* All components that use CustomFab must provide the translation function as a prop


[NOTE]
----
When extending or modifying the plugin components, ensure that the useTranslation() hook is called in parent components and the t prop is passed to CustomFab instances to maintain proper translation functionality and prevent rendering issues.
----

## Floating action button parameters

Use the parameters as shown in the following table to configure your floating action button plugin.




[NOTE]
----
If multiple floating button actions are assigned to the same slot value, the floating buttons are displayed as submenu options within the main floating action button.
----

# Customizing the Quickstart plugin

## About Quickstarts

The Quickstart plugin provides guided onboarding for adminstrators of Red Hat Developer Hub. It displays a customizable drawer interface with interactive quickstart steps that help users get familiar with the platform.


[NOTE]
----
If RBAC is enabled, Quickstart is only accesible to users with administrator permissions.
----

The Quickstart plugin is enabled by default and includes the following components:

Set up authentication:: Set up secure login credentials to protect your account from unauthorized access.

![About Quickstarts]

[NOTE]
----
Your overall progress is tracked and displayed as a progress bar and a progress percentage in the Quickstart footer.
----

## Enabling Quickstart localization in RHDH

You can enable translation key support for Quickstart titles, descriptions, and CTAs, so that users can onboard in their preferred language. In Developer Hub, all existing and newly created Quickstart steps support localization using dedicated translation keys (titleKey, descriptionKey, cta.textKey).


[NOTE]
----
If a translation key is present but the corresponding localized string is missing, the system defaults to the original text defined in the Quickstart configuration (title, description, text). If no translation key is defined at all, the original text is displayed.
----

* You have enabled localization in your RHDH application.

1. For all Quickstart steps (both existing and new) in your configuration file, you must define both the original text and the new localization keys. For example, in the quickstart section of your custom app-config.yaml file, add the titleKey, descriptionKey, and textKey values, as follows:
app-config.yaml fragment

```yaml
app:
  quickstart:
    # Existing Quickstart steps should also be updated with keys
    - title: 'Setup Authentication'
      titleKey: steps.setupAuth.title
      description: 'Learn the basics of navigating the Developer Hub interface'
      descriptionKey: steps.setupAuth.description
      icon: 'home'
      cta:
        text: 'Get Started'
        textKey: steps.setupAuth.ctaTitle
        link: '/catalog'
# ...
```


where:
title:: (Mandatory) Fallback for the title.
titleKey:: Key for the translated title.
description:: (Mandatory) Fallback for the description.
descriptionKey:: Key for the translated description.
text:: (Mandatory) Fallback for the CTA text.
textKey:: Key for the translated CTA text.
2. In your dynamic-plugins.yaml file, add the translationResources section to your red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-quickstart configuration, as follows:
app-config.yaml fragment

```yaml
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-quickstart
      disabled: false
      pluginConfig:
        dynamicPlugins:
          frontend:
            red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-quickstart:
              # translationResources definition is required for translations to work
              translationResources:
                - importName: quickstartTranslations
                  ref: quickstartTranslationRef
              # ... other configurations like mountPoints ...
```


where:
importName:: Enter the name used to reference the import.
ref:: Reference to the resource definition.
3. In your translation file, map the keys from the first step to the localized strings for each supported language.
allTranslations.json fragment

```yaml
"plugin.quickstart": {
  "en": {
    "steps.setupAuth.title": "Manage plugins EN",
    "steps.setupAuth.description": "EN Browse and install extensions to add features, connect with external tools, and customize your experience.",
    "steps.setupAuth.ctaTitle": "Start"
  },
  "fr": {
    "steps.setupAuth.title": "Gérer les plugins FR",
    "steps.setupAuth.description": "FR Parcourez et installez des extensions pour ajouter des fonctionnalités, vous connecter à des outils externes et personnaliser votre expérience.",
    "steps.setupAuth.ctaTitle": "Commencer"
  }
}
```


# Customizing the Tech Radar page in Red Hat Developer Hub

In Red Hat Developer Hub, the Tech Radar page is provided by the tech-radar dynamic plugin, which is disabled by default. For information about enabling dynamic plugins in Red Hat Developer Hub see Configuring dynamic plugins.

In Red Hat Developer Hub, you can configure Learning Paths by passing the data into the app-config.yaml file as a proxy. The base Tech Radar URL must include the /developer-hub/tech-radar proxy.


[NOTE]
----
Due to the use of overlapping pathRewrites for both the tech-radar and homepage quick access proxies, you must create the tech-radar configuration (^api/proxy/developer-hub/tech-radar) before you create the homepage configuration (^/api/proxy/developer-hub).
For more information about customizing the Home page in Red Hat Developer Hub, see Customizing the Home page in Red Hat Developer Hub.
----

You can provide data to the Tech Radar page from the following sources:

* JSON files hosted on GitHub or GitLab.
* A dedicated service that provides the Tech Radar data in JSON format using an API.

## Customizing the Tech Radar page by using a JSON file

For ease of use and simplicity, you can configure the Tech Radar page by using a hosted JSON file.

* You have specified the data sources for the Tech Radar plugin in the integrations section of the app-config.yaml file.
For example, you have enabled Developer Hub integration with GitHub.
* You have enabled the ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-tech-radar and /dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-tech-radar-backend-dynamic plugins.

1. Publish the JSON file containing your Tech Radar data to a web server, such as GitHub or Gitlab.
You can find an example at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/backstage/community-plugins/main/workspaces/tech-radar/plugins/tech-radar-common/src/sampleTechRadarResponse.json.
2. Configure Developer Hub to access the Tech Radar data from the hosted JSON files, by adding the following to the app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
techRadar:
  url: <tech_radar_data_url>
```

<tech_radar_data_url>:: Enter the Tech Radar data hosted JSON URL.

## Customizing the Tech Radar page by using a customization service

For advanced scenarios, you can host your Red Hat Developer Hub customization service to provide data to all configurable Developer Hub pages, such as the Tech Radar page.
You can even use a different service for each page.

* You have specified the data sources for the Tech Radar plugin in the integrations section of the app-config.yaml file.
For example, you have enabled Developer Hub integration with GitHub.
* You have enabled the ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-tech-radar and /dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-tech-radar-backend-dynamic plugins.

1. Deploy your Developer Hub customization service on the same OpenShift Container Platform cluster as your Developer Hub instance.
You can find an example at red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider, that provides the same data as default Developer Hub data.
The customization service provides a Tech Radar data URL such as: http://<rhdh-customization-provider>/tech-radar.
2. Add the dedicated service as an allowed host by adding the following code to the app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
backend:
   reading:
        allow:
          - host: '<rhdh_customization_provider_base_url>'
```

<rhdh_customization_provider_base_url>:: Enter the base URL of your Tech Radar data URL, such as: <rhdh-customization-provider>.
3. Add the following to the app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
techRadar:
    url: <tech_radar_data_url>
```

<tech_radar_data_url>:: Enter your Tech Radar data URL, such as: http://<rhdh-customization-provider>/tech-radar.

# Customizing Red Hat Developer Hub appearance

By modifying the visual aspects of the interface, organizations can align Red Hat Developer Hub with their branding guidelines and improve the overall user experience.

The following default theme configurations are available for Red Hat Developer Hub:

The Red Hat Developer Hub theme:: Default theme configurations to make your developer portal look like a standard Red Hat Developer Hub instance. For more information, see
The Backstage theme:: Default theme configurations to make your developer portal look like a standard Backstage instance. For more information, see

You can change or disable particular parameters in a default theme or create a fully customized theme by modifying the app-config.yaml file. From the app-config.yaml file, you can customize common theme components, including the following components:

* Company name and logo
* Font color, size, and style of text in paragraphs, headings, headers, and buttons
* Header color, gradient, and shape
* Button color
* Navigation indicator color

You can also customize some components from the Developer Hub GUI, such as the theme mode (Light Theme, Dark Theme, or Auto).

## Customizing the theme mode for your Developer Hub instance

You can choose one of the following theme modes for your Developer Hub instance:

* Light
* Dark
* Auto


[NOTE]
----
In Developer Hub, theme configurations are used to change the look and feel of different UI components. So, you might notice changes in different UI components, such as buttons, tabs, sidebars, cards, and tables along with some changes in background color and font used on the RHDH pages.
----

The default theme mode is Auto, which automatically sets the light or dark theme based on your system preferences.

* You are logged in to the Developer Hub web console.

1. From the Developer Hub web console, click Settings.
2. From the Appearance panel, click Light, Dark, or Auto to change the theme mode.
![custom theme mode 1]

## Customizing the branding logo of your Developer Hub instance

You can customize the branding logo of your Developer Hub instance by configuring the branding section in the app-config.yaml file, as shown in the following example:


```yaml
app:
  branding:
    fullLogo: ${BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO} 1
    iconLogo: ${BASE64_EMBEDDED_ICON_LOGO} 2
```


fullLogo:: Enter the logo on the expanded (pinned) sidebar as a base64 encoded image.
iconLogo:: Enter the logo on the collapsed (unpinned) sidebar as a base64 encoded image.

You can format the BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO environment variable as follows:

```yaml
BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO: "data:_<media_type>_;base64,<base64_data>"
```


The following example demonstrates how to customize the BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO using the data:_<media_type>;base64,<base64_data>_ format:

```yaml
SVGLOGOBASE64=$(base64 -i logo.svg)
BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO="data:image/svg+xml;base64,$SVGLOGOBASE64"
```


Replace image/svg+xml with the correct media type for your image (for example, image/png and image/jpeg), and adjust the file extension accordingly. As a result, you can embed the logo directly without referencing an external file.

You can also customize the width of the branding logo by setting a value for the fullLogoWidth field in the branding section, as shown in the following example:


```yaml
app:
  branding:
    fullLogoWidth: 110px
# ...
```


fullLogoWidth:: The default value for the logo width is 110px. The following units are supported: integer, px, em, rem, percentage.

## About the sidebar menu items for your Developer Hub instance

The sidebar menu in Red Hat Developer Hub consists of two main parts that you can configure:

Dynamic plugin menu items:: Your preferences and your active plugins define dynamically one part of the sidebar menu.
Main menu items:: The core navigation structure of sidebar is static.
* Dynamic plugin menu items: These items are displayed beneath the main menu and can be customized based on the plugins installed. The main menu items section is dynamic and can change based on your preferences and installed plugins.

### Customizing the sidebar menu items for your Developer Hub instance

Customize the main menu items using the following steps:

1. Open the app-config.yaml file.
1. To customize the order and parent-child relationships for the main menu items, use the dynamicPlugins.frontend.default.main-menu-items.menuItems field.
2. For dynamic plugin menu items, use the dynamicPlugins.frontend.<package_name>.menuItems field.


```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    default.main-menu-items:
        menuItems:
          default.home:
            title: Home
            icon: home
            priority: 100
            enabled: true
          default.my-group:
            title: My Group
            icon: group
            priority: 90
            enabled: true
          default.catalog:
            title: Catalog
            icon: category
            to: catalog
            priority: 80
            enabled: true
          default.apis:
            title: APIs
            icon: extension
            to: api-docs
            priority: 70
            enabled: true
          default.learning-path:
            title: Learning Paths
            icon: school,
            to: learning-paths
            priority: 60
            enabled: true
          default.create:
            title: Self-service
            icon: add
            to: create
            priority: 50
            enabled: true
```


### Enabling sidebar menu items localization in RHDH

You can add translation key support for sidebar menu items, so that users can onboard in their preferred language. In Developer Hub, all existing and newly created sidebar menu items support localization using the titleKey translation key.


[NOTE]
----
If a translation key is present but the corresponding localized string is missing, the system defaults to the original text defined in the sidebar menu items configuration (title). If no translation key is defined at all, the original text is displayed.
----

* You have enabled localization in your RHDH application.

1. For sidebar menu items in your configuration file, you must define both the original text and the new localization keys. For example, in the dynamicPlugins.frontend.default.main-menu-items.menuItems.default.favorites section of your app-config.yaml file, add the titleKey, as follows:
Example app-config.yaml fragment

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    default.main-menu-items:
        menuItems:
          default.favorites:
            title: Favorites
            titleKey: menuItem.favorites
            icon: favorite
            priority: 100
            enabled: true
```

2. In your translation file, map the titleKey from the first step to the localized strings for each supported language.
Example allTranslations.json fragment

```yaml
{
  "rhdh": {
    "en": {
      "menuItem.favorites": "Favorites"
    },
    "fr": {
      "menuItem.favorites": "Favoris"
    }
  }
}
```


### Configuring a dynamic plugin menu item for your Developer Hub instance

Configure a dynamic plugin menu item using the following step:

* In the app-config.yaml file, update the menuItems section of your <plugin_name> plugin. For example:

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    _<plugin_name>_:
      menuItems:
        <menu_item_name>:
          icon: # home | group | category | extension | school | _<my_icon>_
          title: _<plugin_page_title>_
          priority: 10
          parent: favorites
          enabled: true
```

<plugin_name>:: Enter the plugin name. This name is the same as the scalprum.name key in the package.json file.
<menu_item_name>:: Enter a unique name in the main sidebar navigation for either a standalone menu item or a parent menu item. If this field specifies a plugin menu item, the name of the menu item must match the name using in the corresponding path in dynamicRoutes. For example, if dynamicRoutes defines path: /my-plugin, then menu_item_name must be defined as my-plugin.
icon:: (Optional) Enter the icon name. You can use any of the following icons:
* Default icons, such as home, group, category, extension, and school. To use default icons, set the icon as an (" ") empty string.
* A custom icon, where <my_icon> specifies the name of your custom icon
* An SVG icon, such as: icon: <svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="#ffffff">&#8230;&#8203;</svg>
* An HTML image, such as: icon: https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/20/FFFFFF/shop.png
title:: (Optional) Enter the menu item title. Omit it when the title is already specified in the dynamicRoutes configuration under menuItem.text. To hide the title from the sidebar, set the title as an (" ") empty string.
priority:: (Optional) Enter an integer value to set the order in which menu items appear in the sidebar.
parent:: (Optional) Enter the parent menu item under which the current item is nested. If this field is used, the parent menu item must be defined elsewhere in the menuItems configuration of any enabled plugin. You can define this field for each section.
enabled:: (Optional) Enter false to hide the menu item from the sidebar.
Enter true to display the menu item in the sidebar.

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    _<package_name>_:
      dynamicRoutes:
        - path: /my-plugin
          module: CustomModule
          importName: FooPluginPage
          menuItem:
            icon: fooIcon
            text: Foo Plugin Page
      menuItems:
        my-plugin:
          priority: 10
          parent: favorites
        favorites:

### Modifying or adding a custom menu items for your Developer Hub instance

Modify a main menu item or add a custom menu item using the following step:

* In the app-config.yaml file, add a section to the default.main-menu-items > menuItems section. Use the default. prefix to identify the key as a main menu item.

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    default.main-menu-items:
      menuItems:
        default._<menu_group_parent_item_name>_:
          icon: # home | group | category | extension | school | _<my_icon>_
          title: _<menu_group_parent_title>_
          priority: 10
        default._<menu_item_name>_:
          parent: _<menu_group_parent_item_name>_
          icon:  # home | group | category | extension | school | _<my_icon>_
          title: _<my_menu_title>_
          to: _<path_to_the_menu_target_page>_
          priority: 100
          enabled: true
```

## Configuring entity tab titles

Red Hat Developer Hub provides a default opinionated tab set for catalog entity views.
For consistency with your organization needs, you can rename, reorder, remove, and add tab titles.

* For each tab to modify, enter your desired values in the entityTabs section in your app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
upstream:
  backstage:
    appConfig:
      dynamicPlugins:
        frontend:
         <plugin_name>:
            entityTabs:
              - mountPoint: <mount_point>
                path: <path>
                title: <title>
                priority: <priority>
```

<plugin_name>:: Enter the plugin name, such as backstage-community.plugin-topology.
mountPoint:: Enter the tab mountpoint, such as entity.page.topology.
path:: Enter the tab path, such as /topology.
title:: Enter the tab title, such as Topology.
priority:: Optional.

To reorder tabs, enter the tab priority, such as 42.
Higher priority appears first.

To remove a tab, enter a negative value, such as -1.

## Configuring entity detail tab layout

Each Red Hat Developer Hub entity detail tab has a default opinionated layout.
For consistency with your organization needs, you can change the entity detail tab content when the plugin that contributes the tab content allows a configuration.

* The plugin that contributes the tab content allows a configuration, such as Developer Hub plugins defining a default configuration in a config section.

* Copy the plugin default configuration in your app-config.yaml file, and change the layout properties.

```yaml
global:
  dynamic:
    plugins:
      - package: <package_location>
        disabled: false
        pluginConfig:
          dynamicPlugins:
            frontend:
              <plugin_name>:
                mountPoints:
                  - mountPoint: <mount_point>
                    importName: <import_name>
                    config:
                      layout:
                        gridColumn:
                          lg: span 6
                          xs: span 12
```

package:: Enter your package location, such as ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-tekton.
<plugin_name>:: Enter your plugin name, such as: backstage-community.plugin-tekton.
mountPoint:: Copy the mount point defined in the plugin default configuration, such as: entity.page.ci/cards.
importName:: Copy the import name defined in the plugin default configuration, such as: TektonCI.
layout:: Enter your layout configuration.
The tab content is displayed in a responsive grid that uses a 12 column-grid and supports different breakpoints (xs,
sm, md, lg, xl) that can be specified for a CSS property, such as gridColumn.
The example uses 6 of the 12 columns to show two Tekton CI cards side-by-side on large (lg) screens (span 6 columns) and show them among themselves (xs and above span 12 columns).

## Customizing the theme mode color palettes for your Developer Hub instance

You can customize the color palettes of the light and dark theme modes in your Developer Hub instance by configuring the light.palette and dark.palette parameters in the branding.theme section of the app-config.yaml file, as shown in the following example:


```yaml
app:
  branding:
    theme:
      light:
        palette:
          primary:
            main: <light_primary_color>
          navigation:
            indicator: <light_indicator_color>
        pageTheme:
          default:
            backgroundColor: [<light_background_color_1>, <light_background_color_2>]
      dark:
        palette:
          primary:
            main: <dark_primary_color>
          navigation:
            indicator: <dark_indicator_color>
        pageTheme:
          default:
            backgroundColor: [<dark_background_color_1>, <dark_background_color_2>]
# ...
```


light|dark:: Enter the theme name: light or dark.
palette.primary:main:: Enter the palette main primary color, such as #ffffff or white.
palette.navigation:indicator:: Enter the palette navigation indicator color, which is a vertical bar that indicates the selected tab in the navigation panel, such as #FF0000 or red.
pageTheme:default:backgroundColor:: Enter the default page theme background color, such as #ffffff or white.

* 

## Customizing the page theme header for your Developer Hub instance

You can customize the header color for the light and dark theme modes in your Developer Hub instance by modifying the branding.theme section of the app-config.yaml file. You can also customize the page headers for additional Developer Hub pages, such as the Home, Catalog, and APIs pages.


```yaml
app:
  branding:
    theme:
      light:
        palette: {}
        pageTheme:
          default:
            backgroundColor: "<default_light_background_color>"
            fontColor: "<default_light_font_color>"
            shape: none
          apis:
            backgroundColor: "<apis_light_background_color>"
            fontColor: "<apis_light_font_color>"
            shape: none
      dark:
        palette: {}
        pageTheme:
          default:
            backgroundColor: "<default_dark_background_color>"
            fontColor: "<default_dark_font_color>"
            shape: none
# ...
```


light:: Enter the theme mode, such as light or dark.

## Customizing the font for your Developer Hub instance

You can configure the typography section of the app-config.yaml file to change the default font family and size of the page text, as well as the font family and size of each heading level, as shown in the following example:


```yaml
app:
  branding:
    theme:
      light:
        typography:
          fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
          htmlFontSize: 11 # smaller is bigger
          h1:
            fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
            fontSize: 40
          h2:
            fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
            fontSize: 30
          h3:
            fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
            fontSize: 30

            fontSize: 30
          h5:
            fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
            fontSize: 30
          h6:
            fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
            fontSize: 30
      dark:
        typography:
          fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
          htmlFontSize: 11 # smaller is bigger
          h1:
            fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
            fontSize: 40
          h2:
            fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
            fontSize: 30
          h3:
            fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
            fontSize: 30
          h4:
            fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
            fontSize: 30
          h5:
            fontFamily: "Times New Roman"
            fontSize: 30

        mode: "light"
      dark:
        variant: "rhdh"
        mode: "dark"
```


### Default Red Hat Developer Hub page themes

The default Developer Hub header color is white in light mode and black in dark mode, as shown in the following app-config.yaml file configuration:


```yaml
app:
  branding:
    theme:
      light:
        palette: {}
        defaultPageTheme: default
        pageTheme:
          default:
            backgroundColor: "#ffffff"
      dark:
        palette: {}
        defaultPageTheme: default
        pageTheme:
          default:
            backgroundColor: "#0f1214"
```


## Default Backstage theme

You can use the default Backstage theme configurations to make your Developer Hub instance look like a standard Backstage instance. You can also modify the app-config.yaml file to customize or disable particular parameters.

### Default Backstage theme color palette

The app-config.yaml file uses the following configurations for the default Backstage color palette:


```yaml
app:
  branding:
    theme:
      light:
        variant: "backstage"
        mode: "light"

Alternatively, you can use the following variant and mode values in the app-config.yaml file to apply the previous default configuration:


```yaml
app:
  branding:
    theme:
      light:
        variant: "backstage"
        mode: "light"
      dark:
        variant: "backstage"
        mode: "dark"
```


### Default Backstage page themes

The default Backstage header color is white in light mode and black in dark mode, as shown in the following app-config.yaml file configuration:

## Loading a custom Developer Hub theme by using a dynamic plugin

You can load a custom Developer Hub theme from a dynamic plugin.

1. Export a theme provider function in your dynamic plugin, for example:
Sample myTheme.ts fragment

```javascript
import { lightTheme } from './lightTheme'; // some custom theme
import { UnifiedThemeProvider } from '@backstage/theme';
export const lightThemeProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => (
  <UnifiedThemeProvider theme={lightTheme} children={children} />
);
```


For more information about creating a custom theme, see Backstage documentation - Creating a Custom Theme.
2. Configure Developer Hub to load the theme in the UI by using the themes configuration field:
app-config.yaml fragment

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    example.my-custom-theme-plugin:
      themes:
        - id: light
          title: Light
          variant: light
          icon: someIconReference
          importName: lightThemeProvider
```

id:: Enter your theme ID, such as my_theme.
Enter dark to override the default Developer Hub dark theme.
Enter light to override the default Developer Hub light theme.

* The theme is available in the Developer Hub Settings page.

## Custom component options for your Developer Hub instance

There are two component variants that you can use to customize various components of your Developer Hub theme:

* Patternfly
* MUI

In addition to assigning a component variant to each parameter in the light or dark theme mode configurations, you can toggle the rippleEffect on or off.

The following code shows the options that you can use in the app-config.yaml file to configure the theme components for your Developer Hub instance:


```yaml
app:
  branding:
    theme:
      light:
        options:
          rippleEffect: off / on
          paper: patternfly / mui
          buttons: patternfly / mui
          inputs: patternfly / mui
          accordions: patternfly / mui
          sidebars: patternfly / mui
          pages: patternfly / mui
          headers: patternfly / mui
          toolbars: patternfly / mui
          dialogs: patternfly / mui
          cards: patternfly / mui
          tables: patternfly / mui
          tabs: patternfly / mui
      dark:
        options:
          rippleEffect: off / on
          paper: patternfly / mui
          buttons: patternfly / mui
          inputs: patternfly / mui
          accordions: patternfly / mui
          sidebars: patternfly / mui
          pages: patternfly / mui
          headers: patternfly / mui
          toolbars: patternfly / mui
          dialogs: patternfly / mui
          cards: patternfly / mui
          tables: patternfly / mui
          tabs: patternfly / mui
```


# Customizing the Home page

When using your RHDH app-config.yaml file, you can do any of the following tasks:

* Customize and extend the default Home page layout with additional cards that appear based on the plugins you have installed and enabled.
* Change quick access links.
* Add, reorganize, and remove the available homepage cards.

## Available homepage cards

As an administrative user, you can easily integrate custom features or content from any installed plugin into your Home page layout. You can use the additional cards available for configuration based on the frontend plugins you enable.

The following is a list of the available homepage cards:

* Search bar
* Quick access
* Headline
* Markdown
* Placeholder
* Catalog starred entities
* Featured docs

[NOTE]
----
Each card can have a layouts definition and props that depend on the component you use.
----

## Customizing the Home page cards

As an administrator, you can customize the layout and content of the Home page to create a tailored user experience. This includes integrating various specialized cards into the primary view.

The Home page layout uses a 12-column grid system. You can precisely define the position (x), width (w), and height (h) for each card across multiple screen breakpoints:

* Extra-large (xl)
* Large (lg)
* Medium (md)
* Small (sm)
* Extra-small (xs)
* Extra-extra-small (xxs)

The default Home page is as shown in the following app-config.yaml file configuration:


```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      dynamicRoutes:
        - path: /
          importName: DynamicHomePage
      mountPoints:
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: SearchBar
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 10, h: 1, x: 1 }
              lg: { w: 10, h: 1, x: 1 }
              md: { w: 10, h: 1, x: 1 }
              sm: { w: 10, h: 1, x: 1 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 1 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 1 }
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: QuickAccessCard
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 7, h: 8 }
              lg: { w: 7, h: 8 }
              md: { w: 7, h: 8 }
              sm: { w: 12, h: 8 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 8 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 8 }
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: CatalogStarredEntitiesCard
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 5, h: 4, x: 7 }
              lg: { w: 5, h: 4, x: 7 }
              md: { w: 5, h: 4, x: 7 }
              sm: { w: 12, h: 4 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 4 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 4 }
```


* You have administrative access and can modify the app-config.yaml file for dynamic plugin configurations.

* Configure different cards for your Home page in Red Hat Developer Hub as shown in the following code:
Search:: 

You can use the SearchBar card to provide essential search functionality directly on the Home page.

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      mountPoints:
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: SearchBar
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 10, h: 1, x: 1 }
              lg: { w: 10, h: 1, x: 1 }
              md: { w: 10, h: 1, x: 1 }
              sm: { w: 10, h: 1, x: 1 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 1 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 1 }
            props:
              path: /search
              queryParam: query
```
Quick access:: 

You can use the QuickAccessCard card to function as a customizable shortcut panel.

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      mountPoints:
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: QuickAccessCard
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { h: 8 }
              lg: { h: 8 }
              md: { h: 8 }
              sm: { h: 8 }
              xs: { h: 8 }
              xxs: { h: 8 }
            props:
              title: Quick Access
              path: /quickaccess
```
Headline:: 

You can use the Headline card to display important information.

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      mountPoints:
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: Headline
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { h: 1 }
              lg: { h: 1 }
              md: { h: 1 }
              sm: { h: 1 }
              xs: { h: 1 }
              xxs: { h: 1 }
            props:
              title: Important info
```
Markdown:: 

You can use the Markdown card to display richly formatted content directly within the Home page layout. This card uses Markdown syntax to present structured information, such as lists and links (documentation and plugin repositories).

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      mountPoints:
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards

## Defining the layout of the Red Hat Developer Hub Home page

The Home page uses a 12-column grid to position your cards. You can use the optimal parameters to define the layout of your Developer Hub Home page.

* Include the following optimal parameters in each of your breakpoints:
* width (w)
* height (h)
* position (x and y)

* Configure your Developer Hub app-config.yaml configuration file by choosing one of the following options:
* Use the full space on smaller windows and half of the space on larger windows as follows:


```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      mountPoints:
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: Placeholder
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 6, h: 2 }
              lg: { w: 6, h: 2 }
              md: { w: 6, h: 2 }
              sm: { w: 12, h: 2 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 2 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 2 }
            props:
              showBorder: true
              debugContent: a placeholder
```


* Show the cards side by side by defining the x parameter as shown in the following example:


```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      mountPoints:
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: Placeholder
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 6, h: 2 }
              lg: { w: 6, h: 2 }
              md: { w: 6, h: 2 }
              sm: { w: 12, h: 2 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 2 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 2 }
            props:
              showBorder: true
              debugContent: left
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: Placeholder
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 6, h: 2, x: 6 }
              lg: { w: 6, h: 2, x: 6 }
              md: { w: 6, h: 2, x: 6 }
              sm: { w: 12, h: 2, x: 0 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 2, x: 0 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 2, x: 0 }
            props:
              showBorder: true
              debugContent: right
```


However, you can see a second card below this card by default.

* Show the cards in three columns by defining the x parameter as shown in the following example:


```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      mountPoints:
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: Placeholder
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 4, h: 2 }
              lg: { w: 4, h: 2 }
              md: { w: 4, h: 2 }
              sm: { w: 6, h: 2 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 2 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 2 }
            props:
              showBorder: true
              debugContent: left
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: Placeholder
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 4, h: 2, x: 4 }
              lg: { w: 4, h: 2, x: 4 }
              md: { w: 4, h: 2, x: 4 }
              sm: { w: 6, h: 2, x: 6 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 2 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 2 }
            props:
              showBorder: true
              debugContent: center
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: Placeholder
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 4, h: 2, x: 8 }
              lg: { w: 4, h: 2, x: 8 }
              md: { w: 4, h: 2, x: 8 }
              sm: { w: 6, h: 2 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 2 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 2 }
            props:
              showBorder: true
              debugContent: right
```


## Customizing your dynamic homepage to optimize your workflow

You can customize your homepage to suit your preferences using the drag-and-drop, resizing, and widget management functionality.

You can do the following actions with the customizable homepage:

* Drag and drop: Move cards around the layout
* Resize: Adjust card dimensions
* Add widget: Select from available cards to add to the homepage
* Remove cards: Delete cards from the homepage
* Restore defaults: Reset to the original card configuration
* User persistence: Settings are saved depending on how you use Backstage Storage API

Additional cards automatically appear based on the installed and enabled plugins. The plugins provide the following two main components:

* DynamicHomePage: The read-only homepage that displays configured cards without your customization.
* DynamicCustomizableHomePage: The interactive homepage that allows users to move, resize, and manage cards.

The default homepage displays the OnboardingSection, the EntitySection, and the TemplateSection cards by default. These cards define the default width (w) and height (h) for the cards at various responsiveness levels.

The homepage automatically loads the following configuration:


```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      dynamicRoutes:
        - path: /
          importName: DynamicHomePage
      mountPoints:
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: OnboardingSection
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 12, h: 6 }
              lg: { w: 12, h: 6 }
              md: { w: 12, h: 7 }
              sm: { w: 12, h: 8 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 9 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 14 }
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: EntitySection
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 12, h: 7 }
              lg: { w: 12, h: 7 }
              md: { w: 12, h: 8 }
              sm: { w: 12, h: 9 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 11 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 15 }
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: TemplateSection
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 12, h: 5 }
              lg: { w: 12, h: 5 }
              md: { w: 12, h: 5 }
              sm: { w: 12, h: 5 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 7 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 13 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 7.5 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 13.5 }
```


* You can arrange the cards and adjust their dimensions using the drag-and-drop and resize functionality. The following is an example of an interactive homepage where you can add, remove, move, and resize cards:

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      dynamicRoutes:
        - path: /
          importName: DynamicCustomizableHomePage
      mountPoints:
         - mountPoint: home.page/cards
           importName: OnboardingSection
           config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 12, h: 6 }
              lg: { w: 12, h: 6 }
              md: { w: 12, h: 7 }
              sm: { w: 12, h: 8 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 9 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 14 }
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: EntitySection
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 12, h: 7 }
              lg: { w: 12, h: 7 }
              md: { w: 12, h: 8 }
              sm: { w: 12, h: 9 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 11 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 15 }
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: TemplateSection
          config:
            layouts:
              xl: { w: 12, h: 5 }
              lg: { w: 12, h: 5 }
              md: { w: 12, h: 5 }
              sm: { w: 12, h: 5 }
              xs: { w: 12, h: 7.5 }
              xxs: { w: 12, h: 13.5 }
        # Additional cards available in "Add widget" dialog
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: RecentlyVisitedCard
        - mountPoint: home.page/cards
          importName: TopVisitedCard
```

* You can change the title by overriding the title property of the dynamic homepage plugin as shown in the following example:

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      dynamicRoutes:
        - path: /
          importName: DynamicHomePage # or DynamicCustomizableHomePage for customizable homepage
          config:
            props:
              title: 'Howdy {{firstName}} or {{displayName}}'
```


The title property supports two variables:
* {{displayName}}: This contains the full displayName of the catalog entity.
* {{firstName}}: This contains the first part (separated by a space) of the displayName.
* You can use a subtitle property which is not used by default as shown in the following example:

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      dynamicRoutes:
        - path: /
          importName: DynamicHomePage # or DynamicCustomizableHomePage
          config:
            props:
              title: Our custom RHDH instance
               subtitle: 'Hello {{displayName}}'
```


## Customizing QuickAccessCard card icons on the Red Hat Developer Hub homepage

As an administrator, you can customize the QuickAccessCard card icons on the Red Hat Developer Hub homepage to enhance its visual appeal and user experience. You can integrate custom branding or standard icons by leveraging a remote JSON configuration file.

1. Add the JSON Data source. The QuickAccessCard card on the homepage supports loading data from a JSON file. This JSON file can be hosted in your GitHub repository or any accessible endpoint.
2. Configure the Proxy in your RHDH app-config.yaml file.

To allow the homepage to fetch data from the hosted JSON file, add the following proxy configuration to your RHDH app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
proxy:
  endpoints:
  # customize your backstage instance
  '/developer-hub':
    target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ # For example, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
    pathRewrite:
      '^/api/proxy/developer-hub$': <path-to-your>.json # For example, /redhat-developer/rhdh/main/packages/app/public/homepage/data.json
    changeOrigin: true
    secure: true
```


The following table lists the supported icon types:




[NOTE]
----
SVGs must be valid strings when stored inside JSON (use single quotes inside <svg>).

# Customizing the Quick access card

To access the Home page in Red Hat Developer Hub, the base URL must include the /developer-hub proxy. You can configure the Home page by passing the data into the app-config.yaml file as a proxy. You can provide data to the Home page from the following sources:

* JSON files hosted on GitHub or GitLab.
* A dedicated service that provides the Home page data in JSON format using an API.

## Using hosted JSON files to provide data to the Quick access card

* You have installed Red Hat Developer Hub by using either the Operator or Helm chart.
See Installing Red Hat Developer Hub on OpenShift Container Platform.

* To access the data from the JSON files, add the following code to the app-config.yaml Developer Hub configuration file:
* Add the following code to the app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
proxy:
  endpoints:
    # Other Proxies
    # customize developer hub instance
    '/developer-hub':
      target: <DOMAIN_URL> # i.e https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
      pathRewrite:
        '^/api/proxy/developer-hub': <path to json file> # i.e /redhat-developer/rhdh/main/packages/app/public/homepage/data.json
      changeOrigin: true
      secure: true
      # Change to "false" in case of using self hosted cluster with a self-signed certificate
      headers:
	<HEADER_KEY>: <HEADER_VALUE> # optional and can be passed as needed i.e Authorization can be passed for private GitHub repo and PRIVATE-TOKEN can be passed for private GitLab repo
```


## Using a dedicated service to provide data to the Quick access card

When using a dedicated service, you can do the following tasks:

* Use the same service to provide the data to all configurable Developer Hub pages or use a different service for each page.
* Use the red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider as an example service, which provides data for both the Home and Tech Radar pages. The red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider service provides the same data as default Developer Hub data. You can fork the red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider service repository from GitHub and modify it with your own data, if required.
* Deploy the red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider service and the Developer Hub Helm chart on the same cluster.

* You have installed the Red Hat Developer Hub using Helm chart.
For more information, see Installing Red Hat Developer Hub on OpenShift Container Platform with the Helm chart.

To use a separate service to provide the Home page data, complete the following steps:

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click +Add > Import from Git.
2. Enter the URL of your Git repository into the Git Repo URL field.
To use the red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider service, add the URL for the red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider repository or your fork of the repository containing your customizations.
3. On the General tab, enter red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider in the Name field and click Create.
4. On the Advanced Options tab, copy the value from Target Port.

[NOTE]
----
Target Port automatically generates a Kubernetes or OpenShift Container Platform service to communicate with.
----
5. Add the following code to the app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
proxy:
  endpoints:
    # Other Proxies
    # customize developer hub instance
    '/developer-hub':
      target: ${HOMEPAGE_DATA_URL} 1
      changeOrigin: true
      # Change to "false" in case of using self-hosted cluster with a self-signed certificate
      secure: true
```

http://<SERVICE_NAME>:8080, for example, http://rhdh-customization-provider:8080.

[NOTE]
----
The red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider service contains the 8080 port by default. If you are using a custom port, you can specify it with the 'PORT' environmental variable in the app-config.yaml file.
----
6. Replace the HOMEPAGE_DATA_URL by adding the URL to rhdh-secrets or by directly replacing it in your custom ConfigMap.
7. Delete the Developer Hub pod to ensure that the new configurations are loaded correctly.

* To view the service, go to the OpenShift Container Platform web console and click Networking > Service.

[NOTE]
----
You can also view Service Resources in the Topology view.
----
* Ensure that the provided API URL for the Home page returns the data in JSON format as shown in the following example:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Dropdown 1",
    "isExpanded": false,
    "links": [
      {
        "iconUrl": "https://imagehost.com/image.png",
        "label": "Dropdown 1 Item 1",
        "url": "https://example.com/"
      },
      {
        "iconUrl": "https://imagehost2.org/icon.png",
        "label": "Dropdown 1 Item 2",
        "url": ""
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "title": "Dropdown 2",
    "isExpanded": true,
    "links": [
      {
        "iconUrl": "http://imagehost3.edu/img.jpg",
        "label": "Dropdown 2 Item 1",
        "url": "http://example.com"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```


[NOTE]
----
If the request call fails or is not configured, the Developer Hub instance falls back to the default local data.
----
* If the images or icons do not load, then allowlist them by adding your image or icon host URLs to the content security policy (csp) img-src in your custom ConfigMap as shown in the following example:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: app-config.yaml
data:
  app-config.yaml: |
    app:
      title: Red Hat Developer Hub
    backend:
      csp:
        connect-src:
          - "'self'"
          - 'http:'
          - 'https:'
        img-src:
          - "'self'"
          - 'data:'
          - <image host url 1>
          - <image host url 2>
          - <image host url 3>
    # Other Configurations
```


# Customizing the RHDH Metadata card on the Settings page

The Settings page in Red Hat Developer Hub contains a RHDH Metadata card. By default, the RHDH Metadata card shows the RHDH Version and Backstage Version of your Red Hat Developer Hub instance. When you click the Show more icon, the card expands to also show Upstream, Midstream, and Build Time information.

You can override the default to show custom build information about your Red Hat Developer Hub instance in the card. You can customize the card title as well as the card contents.

To customize the RHDH Metadata card, complete the following step:

* In your app-config.yaml file, configure the buildinfo field. For example:

```yaml
buildInfo:
  title: _<metadata_card_title>_
  card:
    TechDocs builder: '_<techdocs_builder>_'
    Authentication provider: '_<authentication_provider>_'
    RBAC: disabled
  full: true
```


where
<metadata_card_title>:: Specifies the title that you want to display on the customized card.
<techdocs_builder>:: Specifies whether to generate and publish the docs or to only fetch the docs when using the default build strategy. Possible values are local or external. If you want to generate and publish the docs, set the techdocs.builder field to local in your app-config.yaml file. If you only want to fetch the docs without generating and publishing them, set the techdocs.builder field to external.
<authentication_provider>:: Specifies the authentication provider that you want to use. Example values are GitHub or GitLab.
full:: Specifies what information is shown on the customized card. Possible values are true or false. If set to true, only the information specified in this configuration is shown on the card. If set to false, the specified information is shown on the card along with the build versions. The default value is true.

The Settings page displays a card with a custom title and custom build information about your Red Hat Developer Hub instance.

# Localization in Red Hat Developer Hub

## Enabling the localization framework in Developer Hub

Enabling localization enhances accessibility, improves the user experience for a global audience, and assists organizations in meeting language requirements in specific regions.

The language settings of Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) use English by default. In RHDH 1.8, you can choose to use one of the following supported languages:

* English (en)
* French (fr)

1. To enable the localization framework in your RHDH application, add the i18n section to your custom Developer Hub app-config.yaml configuration file:
app-config.yaml fragment with localization i18n fields

```yaml
...
i18n:
  locales: # List of supported locales. Must include en, otherwise the translation framework will fail to load.
    - en
    - fr
  defaultLocale: en # Optional. Defaults to en if not specified.
...
```


## Selecting the language for your Developer Hub instance

You can choose to use one of the following supported languages:

* English (default)
* French

* You are logged in to the Developer Hub web console.
* You have enabled the localization framework in your RHDH instance.

1. From the Developer Hub web console, click the down arrow next to your profile name, then click Settings.
2. From the Appearance panel, click the language dropdown to select your language of choice.
![customize language dropdown]

### Language persistence

When you change the language in the UI, your preference is saved to storage. On next login or refresh, your chosen language setting is restored. Guest users cannot persist language preferences.

Default language selection uses the following priority order:

1. Browser language priority: The system first checks the user's browser language preferences to provide a personalized experience.
2. Configuration priority: If no browser language matches the supported locales, the defaultLocale from the i18n configuration is used as a fallback.
3. Fallback priority: If neither browser preferences nor configuration provide a match, defaults to en.

Red Hat Developer Hub automatically saves and restores user language settings across browser sessions. This feature is enabled by default and uses database storage. To opt-out and use browser storage instead, add the following to your app-config.yaml configuration file:


```yaml
userSettings:
  persistence: browser
```


where:

userSettings:persistence:: Enter browser to opt-out and use browser local storage. Optionally, set this value to database to persist across browsers and devices. This is the default setting and does not require this configuration to be set.

## Localization support for plugins

### Overriding translations

In RHDH 1.8, you can override plugin translation strings without modifying the plugin source code.

* You have enabled localization in your RHDH application.
* For an Operator-installed RHDH instance, you have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc). For more information about installing oc, see Installing the OpenShift CLI.

1. Create a JSON file containing the translation strings that you want to override, as shown in the following example:
allTranslations.json fragment with translation string overrides

```json
{
  "plugin.global-floating-action-button": {
    "en": {
      "fab.quay.label": "QUAY EN JSON",
      "fab.rbac.label": "RBAC EN JSON",
      "fab.rbac.tooltip": "RBAC EN tooltip JSON"
    },
    "fr": {
      "fab.quay.label": "QUAY French JSON",
      "fab.quay.tooltip": "QUAY french tooltip JSON",
      "fab.rbac.label": "RBAC French JSON",
      "fab.rbac.tooltip": "RBAC french tooltip JSON"
    }
  },
  "plugin.global-header": {
    "en": {
      "applicationLauncher.developerHub": "Developer Hub EN JSON"
    },
    "fr": {
      "applicationLauncher.developerHub": "Developer Hub French JSON"
    }
  }
}
```

2. Log in to your cluster and create a config map for your translations override strings:

```bash
oc create configmap all-translations \
    --from-file=/<path-to>/allTranslations.json
```

3. Update your deployment configuration based on your installation method:
1. For an Operator-installed RHDH instance, update your Backstage custom resource (CR). For more information about configuring a CR, see Using the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator to run Developer Hub with your custom configuration.
1. In the spec.application.extraFiles section, add the translations custom app configuration as shown in the following example:
Backstage custom resource fragment

```yaml
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha3
kind: Backstage
spec:
  application:
    extraFiles:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src/translations
      configMaps:
        - name: all-translations
```

2. For a Helm-installed RHDH instance, update your Developer Hub Backstage Helm chart to mount in the Developer Hub filesystem your files from the all-translations config map:
1. In the Developer Hub Helm chart, go to Root Schema → Backstage chart schema → Backstage parameters → Backstage container additional volume mounts.
2. Select Add Backstage container additional volume mounts and add the following values:
mountPath:: /opt/app-root/src/translations
name:: all-translations
3. Add the translations to the Backstage container additional volumes in the Developer Hub Helm chart:
name:: all-translations
configMap:: 
defaultMode:: 420
name:: all-translations
4. Update the i18n section to your custom Developer Hub app-config.yaml configuration file to include the following translation override file:
app-config.yaml fragment with localization i18n fields

```yaml
i18n:
  locales: # List of supported locales. Must include en, otherwise the translation framework will fail to load.
    - en
    - fr
  defaultLocale: en # Optional. Defaults to en if not specified.
  overrides: # List of JSON translation files applied in order (last file wins).  Each file may override/add translations for one or more plugins/locales
    - /opt/app-root/src/translations/all-translations.json
```

### Best practices for implementing localization support for custom plugins in RHDH

When you add localization support to your RHDH plugins, the following best practices help ensure that you establish a robust, type-safe, and future-proof localization workflow, separating the immutable source text from the organized key structure, and ensuring reliable deployment across all targeted languages:

Do not modify original English strings:: This preserves the source of truth for all translators, preventing unexpected changes that would invalidate existing translations and ensuring consistency across all versions.
Use flat dot notation in translation files:: Flat dot notation, for example page.title, follows the standard i18next library convention, which optimizes runtime lookups and keeps the actual translation values concise and easy to manage for translation services.
Use nested objects in the reference file for TypeScript support:: This allows the TypeScript compiler to enforce structural type checking on your translation keys, catching errors during development rather than at runtime.
Test with mocks to ensure translations work correctly:: This isolates the translation logic, guaranteeing the correct keys are passed and rendered without relying on a full environment setup or external translation files during unit testing.
Add all languages to your application configuration:: This ensures that the RHDH application initializes and loads all necessary language resources at startup, making the locales immediately available for users to select in the UI.



### Implementing localization support for your custom plugins

You can implement localization support in your custom RHDH plugins so that your plugins are accessible to a diverse, international user base and follow recommended best practices.

1. Create the following translation files in your plugin's src/translations/ directory:
src/translations/ref.ts English reference

```json
import { createTranslationRef } from "@backstage/core-plugin-api/alpha";

export const myPluginMessages = {
 page: {
   title: "My Plugin",
   subtitle: "Plugin description",
 },
 common: {
   exportCSV: "Export CSV",
   noResults: "No results found",
 },
 table: {
   headers: {
     name: "Name",
     count: "Count",
   },
 },
};

export const myPluginTranslationRef = createTranslationRef({
 id: "plugin.my-plugin",
 messages: myPluginMessages,
});
```

src/translations/de.ts German translation

```json
import { createTranslationMessages } from "@backstage/core-plugin-api/alpha";
import { myPluginTranslationRef } from "./ref";

const myPluginTranslationDe = createTranslationMessages({
 ref: myPluginTranslationRef,
 messages: {
   "page.title": "Mein Plugin",
   "page.subtitle": "Plugin-Beschreibung",
   "common.exportCSV": "CSV exportieren",
   "common.noResults": "Keine Ergebnisse gefunden",
   "table.headers.name": "Name",
   "table.headers.count": "Anzahl",
 },
});

export default myPluginTranslationDe;
```

src/translations/fr.ts French translation

```json
import { createTranslationMessages } from "@backstage/core-plugin-api/alpha";
import { myPluginTranslationRef } from "./ref";

const myPluginTranslationFr = createTranslationMessages({
 ref: myPluginTranslationRef,
 messages: {
   "page.title": "Mon Plugin",
   "page.subtitle": "Description du plugin",
   "common.exportCSV": "Exporter CSV",
   "common.noResults": "Aucun résultat trouvé",
   "table.headers.name": "Nom",
   "table.headers.count": "Nombre",
 },
});

export default myPluginTranslationFr;
```

src/translations/index.ts Translation resource

```json
import { createTranslationResource } from "@backstage/core-plugin-api/alpha";
import { myPluginTranslationRef } from "./ref";

export const myPluginTranslations = createTranslationResource({
 ref: myPluginTranslationRef,
 translations: {
   de: () => import("./de"),
   fr: () => import("./fr"),
 },
});

export { myPluginTranslationRef };
```

2. Create translation hooks file, as follows:
src/hooks/useTranslation.ts Translation hooks

```json
import { useTranslationRef } from "@backstage/core-plugin-api/alpha";
import { myPluginTranslationRef } from "../translations";

export const useTranslation = () => useTranslationRef(myPluginTranslationRef);
```

3. Update your plugin components to replace hard-coded strings with translation calls as shown in the following example:
Before (hardcoded):

```json
const MyComponent = () => {
 return (
   <div>
     <h1>My Plugin</h1>
     <button>Export CSV</button>
   </div>
 );
};
```

After (translated):

```json
import { useTranslation } from '../hooks/useTranslation';

const MyComponent = () => {
 const { t } = useTranslation();

 return (
   <div>
     <h1>{t('page.title')}</h1>
     <button>{t('common.exportCSV')}</button>
   </div>
 );
};
```

4. (Optional) If your content contains variables, use interpolation:

```json
// In your translation files
'table.pagination.topN': 'Top {{count}} items'

// In your component
const { t } = useTranslation();
const message = t('table.pagination.topN', { count: '10' });
```

5. (Optional) If your content contains dynamic translation keys (for example, from your plugin configuration):

```json
// Configuration object with translation keys
const CARD_CONFIGS = [
 { id: 'overview', titleKey: 'cards.overview.title' },
 { id: 'details', titleKey: 'cards.details.title' },
 { id: 'settings', titleKey: 'cards.settings.title' },
];

// In your component
const { t } = useTranslation();

const CardComponent = ({ config }) => {
 return (
   <div>
     <h2>{t(config.titleKey as any)}</h2>
     {/* Use 'as any' for dynamic keys */}
   </div>
 );
};
```

6. Export the translation resources
src/alpha.ts file fragment

```json
// Export your plugin
export { myPlugin } from "./plugin";

// Export translation resources for RHDH
export { myPluginTranslations, myPluginTranslationRef } from "./translations";
```

7. Update your dynamic-plugins.default.yaml file, as follows:
dynamic-plugins.default.yaml file fragment

```json
backstage-community.plugin-my-plugin:
 translationResources:
   - importName: myPluginTranslations
     ref: myPluginTranslationRef
     module: Alpha
```

8. Update your package.json file as follows:
package.json file fragment

```json
"exports": {
    ".": "./src/index.ts",
    "./alpha": "./src/alpha.ts",
    "./package.json": "./package.json"
  },
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "types": "src/index.ts",
  "typesVersions": {
    "*": {
      "alpha": [
        "src/alpha.ts"
      ],
      "package.json": [
        "package.json"
      ]
    }
  }
```


To verify your translations, create a test mock file. For example:


```json
import { myPluginMessages } from "../translations/ref";

function flattenMessages(obj: any, prefix = ""): Record<string, string> {
 const flattened: Record<string, string> = {};
 for (const key in obj) {
   if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
     const value = obj[key];
     const newKey = prefix ? `${prefix}.${key}` : key;
     if (typeof value === "object" && value !== null) {
       Object.assign(flattened, flattenMessages(value, newKey));
     } else {
       flattened[newKey] = value;
     }
   }
 }
 return flattened;
}

const flattenedMessages = flattenMessages(myPluginMessages);

export const mockT = (key: string, params?: any) => {
 let message = flattenedMessages[key] || key;
 if (params) {
   for (const [paramKey, paramValue] of Object.entries(params)) {
     message = message.replace(
       new RegExp(`{{${paramKey}}}`, "g"),
       String(paramValue),
     );
   }
 }
 return message;
};

export const mockUseTranslation = () => ({ t: mockT });
```



```json
import { mockUseTranslation } from "../test-utils/mockTranslations";

jest.mock("../hooks/useTranslation", () => ({
 useTranslation: mockUseTranslation,
}));

// Your test code...
```
