## Configuring the Adoption Insights plugin in Red Hat Developer Hub

The Adoption Insights plugin is preinstalled and enabled on a Developer Hub instance by default. You can disable or enable the Adoption Insights plugin and change other parameters, by configuring the app-config ConfigMap, which is created by the Red Hat Developer Hub Helm chart or Operator.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you used the Developer Preview of the Adoption Insights plugin and configured the feature manually, you must remove those earlier configuration changes as they are no longer required.
In your dynamic plugins ConfigMap, for example: dynamic-plugins-rhdh.yaml, update the package-disabled value of the plugin to false as shown in the following example:

```yaml
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-analytics-provider-segment
    disabled: false
```
