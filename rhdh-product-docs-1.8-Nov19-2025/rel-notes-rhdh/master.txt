# Breaking changes

This section lists breaking changes in Red Hat Developer Hub 1.8.

## Argo CD, Tekton, and Topology plugins require the Kubernetes Frontend and Kubernetes Backend plugins

With this update, the Argo CD, Tekton, and Topology plugins requires the Kubernetes Frontend and Kubernetes Backend plugins. Before this update, these plugins depended only on the Kubernetes Backend plugin, and the feature provided by the Kubernetes Frontend plugin where provided by the removed @janus-idp/shared-react package.

1. Enable the Kubernetes Frontend and Kubernetes Backend plugins.

```yaml
global:
  dynamic:
    plugins:
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-kubernetes
        disabled: false
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-kubernetes-backend-dynamic
        disabled: false
```

2. The Kubernetes Frontend plugin shows automatically a Kubernetes tab for Software Catalog entities with the annotation backstage.io/kubernetes-id or backstage.io/kubernetes-namespace.

Optionally, to hide the Kubernetes tab in the Software Catalog, disable the feature with this dynamic plugin configuration:

```yaml
global:
  dynamic:
    plugins:
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-kubernetes
        disabled: false
        pluginConfig:
          dynamicPlugins:
            frontend:
              backstage.plugin-kubernetes:
                mountPoints: []
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-kubernetes-backend-dynamic
        disabled: false
```

# Fixed issues

This section lists issues fixed in Red Hat Developer Hub 1.8.

## Fixed issues in 1.8.0

### Improved startup speed with updated init container image pull policy for Developer Hub Helm Chart

With this update, the pull policy for the init container image of the Developer Hub Helm Chart was changed from Always to IfNotPresent. This change reduces the repeated download time during startup of the container image, which is approximately 2.5 GB, thereby significantly improving startup speed for users.

* RHDHBUGS-1000

### Improved Authentication for Self-Hosted Enterprise SCM Providers

Previously, actions requiring access to a self-hosted enterprise SCM provider failed, returning an error that no authentication provider was available for the specified host.

With this update, the SCM integration correctly identifies and uses the configured authentication provider for the corresponding enterprise host.

* RHDHBUGS-1028

### Customizable image names for job and data index services in Developer Hub Helm Chart

Previously, when deploying the Developer Hub Helm Chart with the Orchestrator enabled, it was not possible to customize the image names of the job and data index services, for example in disconnected environments. Setting the orchestrator.sonataflowPlatform.jobServiceImage and orchestrator.sonataflowPlatform.dataIndexImage would return a schema validation error from Helm. This update fixes this issue.

* RHDHBUGS-2003

### Network policy installation fix for Developer Hub RHDH Helm Chart with Orchestrator flavor

Before this update, the Developer Hub RHDH Helm Chart would not install Network Policies when the Orchestrator flavor was deployed with serverlessLogicOperator disabled, preventing the Developer Hub Pods from being completely available. This update fixes this situation by installing network policies unconditionally when the orchestrator is enabled.

* RHDHBUGS-2020

### Resolved SonataFlow Pod Crash Issue

In the new release, a timing problem during the RHDH 1.7 installation with Orchestrator plugins, affecting SonataFlow database provisioning, has been addressed. This issue caused SonataFlow pods to repeatedly enter the CrashLoopBackOff state, leading to delays and potential confusion for users. With this update, SonataFlow pods no longer encounter the CrashLoopBackOff state due to the database provisioning delay. This improvement enhances the user experience, as SonataFlow pods now start promptly, eliminating unnecessary wait times.

* RHDHBUGS-2036

### Fixed SCM integration failures for self-hosted enterprise SCM providers

Previously, SCM integration failed for self-hosted enterprise SCM providers because the system could not identify the configured host. This resulted in a No auth provider available error. With this release, the SCM integration now correctly uses the configured authentication provider for the corresponding enterprise host. As a result, end users can now successfully perform actions requiring enterprise SCM access.

* RHDHBUGS-2249

### Fixed incorrect version detection for local plugin updates

Before this update, local plugins within the image were incorrectly detected for updates due to version misidentification. This led to users being unable to update local plugins from wrappers, resulting in outdated functionality. With this release, local plugin updates are now automatically detected, eliminating the need for manual adjustments and ensuring seamless plugin version updates for end users.

* RHDHBUGS-2250

# Fixed security issues

You can view the security issues fixed in Red Hat Developer Hub 1.8 at Red Hat Security Updates.

For 1.8.0, see Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2025:20047.

# Known issues

This section lists known issues in Red Hat Developer Hub 1.8.

## Existing Operator users with Orchestator 1.7 require a manual update in their dynamic-plugins ConfigMap

If you have an existing Operator-backed instance of Developer Hub with the Orchestrator, you must update your dynamic-plugins ConfigMap to set the version of the Orchestrator plugins to 1.8.2 once the Developer Hub Operator is upgraded to 1.8.
Otherwise, the Developer Hub instance will not be upgraded at all.


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: dynamic-plugins-rhdh
data:
  dynamic-plugins.yaml: |
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: &#34;@redhat/backstage-plugin-orchestrator@1.8.2&#34;
        disabled: false
      - package: &#34;@redhat/backstage-plugin-orchestrator-backend-dynamic@1.8.2&#34;
        disabled: false
        dependencies:
          - ref: sonataflow
      - package: &#34;@redhat/backstage-plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-orchestrator-dynamic@1.8.2&#34;
        disabled: false
      - package: &#34;@redhat/backstage-plugin-orchestrator-form-widgets@1.8.2&#34;
        disabled: false
```


* RHDHBUGS-2240

## Deployment update error with dynamic plugin configuration

Updating the deployment configuration using the values.yaml to include specific dynamic plugin configurations might cause an error during the deployment process.

When configuring the dynamicRoutes for the red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page plugin, the use of the placeholder {{firstName}} in a configuration property, for example title, can result in the following fatal deployment error:

"function firstName not defined".

This error prevents the cluster from spinning up correctly.


```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page:
      dynamicRoutes:
        - path: /
          importName: DynamicHomePage
          config:
            props:
              title: 'Howdy {{firstName}} or {{displayName}}'
```


* RHDHBUGS-2227

## Starting time is not displayed correctly in Results pane when workflows are started

There is an known issue with the displayed starting time in the Orchestrator 1.8.2 plugins when starting a workflow. When a workflow starts executing, the starting time is not displayed correctly in the Results window of the workflow instance. It remains this way until the workflow changes state. This will be fixed in a future release.

* RHDHBUGS-2220

## Clicking on the dedicated RHDH local guide link in the UI sidebar also highlights the Catalog item

In this update, the RHDH Local default configuration includes built-in TechDocs. However, when selecting the new "RHDH Local Guide" link in the RHDH Local UI sidebar, the Catalog link is also highlighted.
There is currently no known workaround.

* RHDHBUGS-2132

## Handle installation disabled scenario in the installed packages page

When installation is disabled, the actions on the Installed Packages page are still shown. Similarly, if the YAML file is misconfigured, the actions appear, but the API call fails with an error. This doesn&#8217;t break the UI, the API failure is handled gracefully, and the correct reason for the failure is displayed in the UI.

* RHDHBUGS-2126

## Changes to the Operator default configuration do not persist across operator upgrades

Changes to the Developer Hub Operator default configuration do not persist across operator upgrades. There is no known workaround.

* RHDHBUGS-2102

## Error message when manually accessing plugins without associated entity YAML

This error occurs when a user tries to access a package or plugin that does not have an associated entity YAML. Users will not encounter this error under normal usage; it only appears if they manually modify the plugin or package name in the URL. This ticket will handle this scenario more gracefully by indicating why access to a particular plugin is not allowed.

* RHDHBUGS-2059

## Hide package for entities missing dynamicArtifact value in code editor

For packages with missing spec.dynamicArtifact value in their catalog entity, we currently show - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dis/&#8230;&#8203;

* RHDHBUGS-2058

## Quay and Argo CD require their respective backend plugins to correctly display permissions in the UI.


```yaml
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-quay
    disabled: false
  - package: oci://ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/backstage-community-plugin-quay-backend:bs_1.42.5__1.6.0!backstage-community-plugin-quay-backend
    disabled: false
    pluginConfig:
      quay:
        apiUrl: ${QUAY_API_URL}
        apiKey: ${QUAY_API_KEY}
```



```yaml
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/roadiehq-scaffolder-backend-argocd-dynamic
    disabled: true
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-redhat-argocd
    disabled: false
  - package: oci://ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/backstage-community-plugin-redhat-argocd-backend:bs_1.42.5__0.10.0!backstage-community-plugin-redhat-argocd-backend
    disabled: false
    pluginConfig:
      argocd:
        username: "${ARGOCD_USERNAME}"
        password: "${ARGOCD_PASSWORD}"
        appLocatorMethods:

              - name: argoInstance1
                url: "${ARGOCD_INSTANCE1_URL}"
```


For ArgoCD, you will need to update your app-config.yaml to add its id to permission.rbac.pluginsWithPermission:


```yaml
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    pluginsWithPermission:
      - argocd
```


* RHDHBUGS-2038

## MUI v5 components might render with broken styles in non-bundled plugins

Plugins that are not bundled with Red Hat Developer Hub, meaning not part of the Red Hat Developer Hub wrappers, might experience styling issues or broken visuals when using Material UI v5 components.

1. Workaround
* Add the following code to the plugin’s entry file, such as workspaces/<pluginId>/plugins/<pluginId>/src/index.ts:

```javascript
import { unstable_ClassNameGenerator as ClassNameGenerator } from &#39;@mui/material/className&#39;;

ClassNameGenerator.configure(componentName =&gt; {
  return componentName.startsWith(&#39;v5-&#39;)
    ? componentName
    : `v5-${componentName}`;
});
```


* RHDHBUGS-986

## Out-Of-Memory errors in the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator

To resolve Out-Of-Memory errors in the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator, adjust memory settings manually:

1. Edit the deployment:

```
kubectl edit deployment rhdh-operator -n &lt;namespace&gt;
```

2. In the editor, set the memory request to 1 GiB and the limit to 2 GiB:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: rhdh-operator
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: &#34;1G&#34;
      limits:
        memory: &#34;2G&#34;
```

3. Reapply this change whenever the Operator is actively reconciled. The pod should become healthy, using about 1.07 GiB of memory.
