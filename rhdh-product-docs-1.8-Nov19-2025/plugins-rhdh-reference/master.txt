# Dynamic plugins reference

The dynamic plugin support is based on the backend plugin manager package, which is a service that scans a configured root directory (dynamicPlugins.rootDirectory in the app config) for dynamic plugin packages and loads them dynamically.
You can use the dynamic plugins that come preinstalled with Red Hat Developer Hub or install external dynamic plugins from a public NPM registry.

# Preinstalled dynamic plugins

Red Hat Developer Hub is preinstalled with a selection of dynamic plugins.

The following preinstalled dynamic plugins are enabled by default:

* @backstage-community/plugin-analytics-provider-segment
* @backstage-community/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-quay
* @backstage-community/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-regex
* @backstage/plugin-events-backend
* @backstage/plugin-techdocs
* @backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend
* @backstage/plugin-techdocs-module-addons-contrib
* @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-marketplace
* @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-dynamic-home-page
* @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-global-floating-action-button
* @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-global-header
* @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-marketplace
* @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-marketplace-backend
* @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-adoption-insights
* @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-adoption-insights-backend
* @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-analytics-module-adoption-insights
* @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-quickstart

The dynamic plugins that require custom configuration are disabled by default.

Upon application startup, for each plugin that is disabled by default, the install-dynamic-plugins init container within the Developer Hub pod log displays a message similar to the following:


```yaml
======= Skipping disabled dynamic plugin ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-dynamic
```


To enable this plugin, add a package with the same name to the Helm chart and change the value in the disabled field to ‘false’. For example:


```java
global:
  dynamic:
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-dynamic
        disabled: false
```



[NOTE]
----
The default configuration for a plugin is extracted from the dynamic-plugins.default.yaml file, however, you can use a pluginConfig entry to override the default configuration.
