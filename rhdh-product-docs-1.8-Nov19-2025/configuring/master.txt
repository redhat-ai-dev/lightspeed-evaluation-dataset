# Configuring Red Hat Developer Hub

Learn how to configure Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) for production to work in your IT ecosystem by adding custom config maps and secrets.

# Provisioning and using your custom Red Hat Developer Hub configuration

To configure Red Hat Developer Hub, use these methods, which are widely used to configure a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform application:

* Use config maps to mount files and directories.
* Use secrets to inject environment variables.

Learn to apply these methods to Developer Hub:

1. Provision your custom config maps and secrets to OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Use your selected deployment method to mount the config maps and inject the secrets:
* Use the Red Hat Developer Hub operator to deploy Developer Hub.
* Use the Red Hat Developer Hub Helm chart to deploy Developer Hub.

## Provisioning your custom Red Hat Developer Hub configuration

To configure Red Hat Developer Hub, provision your custom Red Hat Developer Hub config maps and secrets to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) before running Red Hat Developer Hub.


[TIP]
----
On Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can skip this step to run Developer Hub with the default config map and secret.
Your changes on this configuration might get reverted on Developer Hub restart.
----

* By using the OpenShift CLI (oc), you have access, with developer permissions, to the OpenShift cluster aimed at containing your Developer Hub instance.

1. For security, store your secrets as environment variables values in an OpenShift Container Platform secret, rather than in clear text in your configuration files.
Collect all your secrets in the secrets.txt file, with one secret per line in KEY=value form.
* Enter your authentication secrets.
2. Author your custom app-config.yaml file.
This is the main Developer Hub configuration file.
You need a custom app-config.yaml file to avoid the Developer Hub installer to revert user edits during upgrades.
When your custom app-config.yaml file is empty, Developer Hub is using default values.
* To prepare a deployment with the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator on OpenShift Container Platform, you can start with an empty file.
* To prepare a deployment with the Red Hat Developer Hub Helm chart, or on Kubernetes, enter the Developer Hub base URL in the relevant fields in your app-config.yaml file to ensure proper functionality of Developer Hub.
The base URL is what a Developer Hub user sees in their browser when accessing Developer Hub.
The relevant fields are baseUrl in the app and backend sections, and origin in the backend.cors subsection:
Configuring the baseUrl in app-config.yaml

```yaml
app:
  title: Red Hat Developer Hub
  baseUrl: https://<my_developer_hub_domain>

backend:
  auth:
    externalAccess:
      - type: legacy
        options:
          subject: legacy-default-config
          secret: "${BACKEND_SECRET}"
  baseUrl: https://<my_developer_hub_domain>
  cors:
    origin: https://<my_developer_hub_domain>
```
* Optionally, enter your configuration such as:
* Authentication in Red Hat Developer Hub.
* Authorization in Red Hat Developer Hub.
* Customization.
* Configure your OpenShift Container Platform integration.
3. Author your custom dynamic-plugins.yaml file to enable plugins.
By default, Developer Hub enables a minimal plugin set, and disables plugins that require configuration or secrets, such as the GitHub repository discovery plugin and the Role-based access control (RBAC) plugin.

Enable the GitHub repository discovery and the RBAC features:
dynamic.plugins.yaml

```yaml
includes:
  - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github
    disabled: false
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-rbac
    disabled: false
```

4. Provision your custom configuration files to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
1. Create the <my-rhdh-project> {namespace} aimed at containing your Developer Hub instance.

```terminal
$ oc create namespace my-rhdh-project
```

2. Provision your app-config.yaml and dynamic-plugins.yaml files respectively to the my-rhdh-app-config, and dynamic-plugins-rhdh config maps in the <my-rhdh-project> project.

```terminal
$ oc create configmap my-rhdh-app-config --from-file=app-config.yaml --namespace=my-rhdh-project
$ oc create configmap dynamic-plugins-rhdh --from-file=dynamic-plugins.yaml --namespace=my-rhdh-project
```


Alternatively,
create the config maps by using the web console.
3. Provision your secrets.txt file to the my-rhdh-secrets secret in the <my-rhdh-project> project.

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic my-rhdh-secrets --from-file=secrets.txt --namespace=my-rhdh-project
```


Alternatively,
create the secret by using the web console.

* Provision your PostgreSQL database secrets
* Provision your dynamic plugins config map
* Provision your RBAC policies config map

## Using the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator to run Developer Hub with your custom configuration

To use the Developer Hub Operator to run Red Hat Developer Hub with your custom configuration, create your Backstage custom resource (CR) that:

* Mounts files provisioned in your custom config maps.
* Injects environment variables provisioned in your custom secrets.

* By using the OpenShift CLI (oc), you have access, with developer permissions, to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster aimed at containing your Developer Hub instance.
* Your administrator has installed the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator in the cluster.
* You have provisioned your custom config maps and secrets in your <my-rhdh-project> project.

1. Author your Backstage CR in a my-rhdh-custom-resource.yaml file to use your custom config maps and secrets.

Minimal my-rhdh-custom-resource.yaml custom resource example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha3
kind: Backstage
metadata:
  name: my-rhdh-custom-resource
spec:
  application:
    appConfig:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
      configMaps:
         - name: my-rhdh-app-config
    extraEnvs:
      secrets:
         - name: <my_product_secrets>
    extraFiles:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
    route:
      enabled: true
  database:
    enableLocalDb: true
```


my-rhdh-custom-resource.yaml custom resource example with dynamic plugins and RBAC policies config maps, and external PostgreSQL database secrets:

```yaml
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha3
kind: Backstage
metadata:
  name: <my-rhdh-custom-resource>
spec:
  application:
    appConfig:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
      configMaps:
         - name: my-rhdh-app-config
         - name: rbac-policies
    dynamicPluginsConfigMapName: dynamic-plugins-rhdh
    extraEnvs:
      secrets:
         - name: <my_product_secrets>
         - name: my-rhdh-database-secrets
    extraFiles:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
      secrets:
        - name: my-rhdh-database-certificates-secrets
          key: postgres-crt.pem, postgres-ca.pem, postgres-key.key
    route:
      enabled: true
  database:
    enableLocalDb: false
```

Mandatory fields:: No fields are mandatory.
You can create an empty Backstage CR and run Developer Hub with the default configuration.
Optional fields:: 
spec.application.appConfig.configMaps:: Enter your config map name list.

Mount files in the my-rhdh-app-config config map:

```yaml
spec:
  application:
    appConfig:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
      configMaps:
         - name: my-rhdh-app-config
```


Mount files in the my-rhdh-app-config and rbac-policies config maps:

         - name: my-rhdh-app-config
         - name: rbac-policies
```

spec.application.extraEnvs.envs:: Optionally, enter your additional environment variables that are not secrets, such as your proxy environment variables.

Inject your HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY environment variables:

```yaml
spec:
  application:
    extraEnvs:
      envs:
        - name: HTTP_PROXY
          value: 'http://10.10.10.105:3128'
        - name: HTTPS_PROXY
          value: 'http://10.10.10.106:3128'
        - name: NO_PROXY
          value: 'localhost,example.org'
```

spec.application.extraEnvs.secrets:: Enter your environment variables secret name list.

Inject the environment variables in your Red Hat Developer Hub secret:

```yaml
spec:
  application:
    extraEnvs:
      secrets:
         - name: <my_product_secrets>
```


Inject the environment variables in the Red Hat Developer Hub and my-rhdh-database-secrets secrets:

```yaml
spec:
  application:
    extraEnvs:
      secrets:
         - name: <my_product_secrets>
         - name: my-rhdh-database-secrets
```


[NOTE]
----
<my_product_secrets> is your preferred Developer Hub secret name, specifying the identifier for your secret configuration within Developer Hub.
----
spec.application.extraFiles.secrets:: Enter your certificates files secret name and files list.

Mount the postgres-crt.pem, postgres-ca.pem, and postgres-key.key files contained in the my-rhdh-database-certificates-secrets secret:

```yaml
spec:
  application:
    extraFiles:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
      secrets:
        - name: my-rhdh-database-certificates-secrets
          key: postgres-crt.pem, postgres-ca.pem, postgres-key.key
```

spec.database.enableLocalDb:: Enable or disable the local PostgreSQL database.

Disable the local PostgreSQL database generation to use an external postgreSQL database:

```yaml
spec:
  database:
    enableLocalDb: false
```


On a development environment, use the local PostgreSQL database:

```yaml
spec:
  database:
    enableLocalDb: true
```

spec.deployment:: Optionally, enter your deployment configuration.
2. Apply your Backstage CR to start or update your Developer Hub instance:

```terminal
$ oc apply --filename=my-rhdh-custom-resource.yaml --namespace=my-rhdh-project
```


### Injecting extra files and environment variables into Backstage containers

The mountPath field specifies the location where a ConfigMap or Secret is mounted.
The behavior of the mount, whether it includes or excludes a subPath, depends on the specification of the key or mountPath fields.

* If key and mountPath are not specified: Each key or value is mounted as a filename or content with a subPath.
* If key is specified with or without mountPath: The specified key or value is mounted with a subPath.
* If only mountPath is specified: A directory containing all the keys or values is mounted without a subPath.
* If the containers field is not specified: The volume mounts only to the backstage-backend container. By default, files mount only to the backstage-backend container. You can also specify other targets, including a list of containers by name (such as dynamic-plugin-install or selectcustom sidecars) or select all containers in the Backstage Pod.


[NOTE]
----
* OpenShift Container Platform does not automatically update a volume mounted with subPath. By default, the RHDH Operator monitors these ConfigMaps or Secrets and refreshes the RHDH Pod when changes occur.
* For security purposes, Red Hat Developer Hub does not give the Operator Service Account read access to Secrets. As a result, mounting files from Secrets without specifying both mountPath and key is not supported.
----

1. Apply the configuration to your Backstage custom resource (CR). The following code block is an example:

```yaml
spec:
  application:
    extraFiles:
      mountPath: _<default_mount_path>_
      configMaps:
        - name: _<configmap_name_all_entries>_
        - name: _<configmap_name_single_key>_
          key: _<specific_file_key>_
          containers:
            - "*"
        - name: _<configmap_name_custom_path>_
          mountPath: _<custom_cm_mount_path>_
          containers:
            - backstage-backend
            - install-dynamic-plugins
      secrets:
        - name: _<secret_name_single_key>_
          key: _<specific_secret_key>_
          containers:
            - install-dynamic-plugins
        - name: _<secret_name_custom_path>_
          mountPath: _<custom_secret_mount_path>_
      pvcs:
        - name: _<pvc_name_default_path>_
        - name: _<pvc_name_custom_path>_
          mountPath: _<custom_pvc_mount_path>_
    extraEnvs:
      configMaps:
        - name: _<configmap_name_env_var>_
          key: _<env_var_key>_
          containers:
            - "*"
      secrets:
        - name: _<secret_name_all_envs>_
      envs:
        - name: _<static_env_var_name>_
          value: "_<static_env_var_value>_"
          containers:
           - install-dynamic-plugins
```


where:
spec.application.extraFiles.mountPath:: Specifies the default base mount path for files if no specific mountPath is set for a resource (for example, /<default_mount_path>).
spec.application.extraFiles.configMaps.name:: Mounts all entries from <configmap_name_all_entries> to the default mount path.
spec.application.extraFiles.configMaps.key:: Mounts **only the specified key (for example, <specific_file_key>.txt) from the ConfigMap.
spec.application.extraFiles.configMaps.containers:: Targets all containers ("*") for mounting.
spec.application.extraFiles.configMaps.mountPath:: Overrides the default and mounts all ConfigMap entries as a directory at the specified path (for example, /<custom_cm_mount_path>).
spec.application.extraFiles.secrets.key:: Mounts only a specific key from the Secret.
spec.application.extraFiles.secrets.mountPath:: Overrides the default and mounts all Secret entries as a directory at the specified path (for example, /<custom_secret_mount_path>).
spec.application.extraFiles.pvcs.name:: Mounts the PVC to the default mount path, appending the PVC name (for example, /<default_mount_path>/<pvc_name_default_path>).
spec.application.extraFiles.pvcs.mountPath:: Overrides the default and mounts the PVC to the specified path (for example, /<custom_pvc_mount_path>).
spec.application.extraEnvs.configMaps.containers:: Injects the specified ConfigMap key as an environment variable into all containers ("*").
spec.application.extraEnvs.secrets.name:: Injects all keys from the Secret as environment variables into the default container.
spec.application.envs.containers:: Targets only the listed container for the static environment variable injection.


[NOTE]
----
The following explicit options are supported:
* No or an empty field: Mounts only to the backstage-backend container.
* * (asterisk) as the first and only array element: Mounts to all containers.
* Explicit container names, for example, install-dynamic-plugins: Mounts only to the listed containers.
----

The files are mounted with the following correct paths and container targets:



## Using the Red Hat Developer Hub Helm chart to run Developer Hub with your custom configuration

You can use the Red Hat Developer Hub Helm chart to add a custom application configuration file to your OpenShift Container Platform instance.

* By using the OpenShift Container Platform web console, you have access with developer permissions, to an OpenShift Container Platform project named <my-rhdh-project>, aimed at containing your Developer Hub instance.
* You have uploaded your custom configuration files and secrets in your <my-rhdh-project> project.

1. Configure Helm to use your custom configuration files in Developer Hub.
1. Go to the Helm tab to see the list of Helm releases.
2. Click the overflow menu on the Helm release that you want to use and select Upgrade.
3. Use the YAML view to edit the Helm configuration.
4. Set the value of the upstream.backstage.extraAppConfig.configMapRef and upstream.backstage.extraAppConfig.filename parameters as follows:

# Red Hat Developer Hub default configuration

You can deploy a standard Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) instance, understand the structure, and tailor RHDH instance to meet your needs.

## Red Hat Developer Hub default configuration guide

The Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) Operator creates a set of Kubernetes resources to deploy and manage a Backstage instance. The default configuration for these default resources is defined at the Operator level and can be customized for a specific instance using the Backstage Custom Resource (CR). This approach provides a clear starting point while offering flexibility to tailor each deployment.

The default configuration is stored in a ConfigMap named rhdh-default-config located in the rhdh-operator namespace on OpenShift. This ConfigMap contains the YAML manifests that define the foundational structure of the RHDH instance.

You can create a basic RHDH instance by applying an empty Backstage Custom Resource as follows:


```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.redhat.com/v1alpha4
kind: Backstage
metadata:
name: my-rhdh-instance
namespace: rhdh
```


The Operator automatically creates the following resources in the specified RHDH namespace by default based on the default configuration:




[NOTE]
----
{cr-name} is the name of the Backstage Custom Resource, for example 'my-rhdh-instance' in the above example.
----

## Automated Operator features

You can use the Operator to automate several key processes to effectively configure your Backstage application.

### Metadata generation

The Operator automatically generates specific metadata values for all default resources at runtime to ensure your Backstage application functions properly.

For all the default resources, metadata.name is generated according to the rules defined in the Default Configuration files, particularly the Resource name column. For example, Backstage Custom Resource (CR) named mybackstage creates Kubernetes Deployment resource called backstage-mybackstage.

The following metadata is generated for each resource:

* deployment.yaml
* spec.selector.matchLabels[rhdh.redhat.com/app] = backstage-{cr-name}
* spec.template.metadata.labels[rhdh.redhat.com/app] = backstage-{cr-name}
* service.yaml
* spec.selector[rhdh.redhat.com/app] = backstage-{cr-name}
* db-statefulset.yaml
* spec.selector.matchLabels[rhdh.redhat.com/app] = backstage-psql-{cr-name}
* spec.template.metadata.labels[rhdh.redhat.com/app] = backstage-psql-{cr-name}
* db-service.yaml
* spec.selector[rhdh.redhat.com/app] = backstage-psql-{cr-name}

### Multiple resources

You can define and create multiple resources of the same type in a single YAML file. This is applicable to any resource type that is a list in the resource table. To define multiple resources, use the --- delimiter to separate each resource definition.

For example, adding the following code snip to pvcs.yaml creates two PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) called backstage-{cr-name}-myclaim1 and backstage-{cr-name}-myclaim2 and mounts them to the Backstage container accordingly.


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: myclaim1
...
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: myclaim2
...
```


### Default base URLs

The Operator automatically sets the base URLs for your Backstage application in the default app-config ConfigMap known as backstage-appconfig-{CR_name}. The Operator does so based on your Route parameters and the OpenShift cluster ingress domain.

The Operator follows these rules to set the base URLs for your application:

* If the cluster is not OpenShift, the Operator makes no changes.
* If you explicitly set the spec.application.route.enabled field in your Custom Resource (CR) to false, no changes are made.
* If you define spec.application.route.host in the Backstage CR, the base URLs are set to https://<spec.application.route.host>.
* If you specify the spec.application.route.subdomain in the Backstage CR, the base URLs are set to https://<spec.application.route.subdomain>.<cluster_ingress_domain>.
* If no custom host or subdomain is provided, the Operator sets the base URLs to https://backstage-<cr_name>-<namespace>.<cluster_ingress_domain>, which is the default domain for the created Route resource.

The Operator updates the following base URLs in the default app-config ConfigMap:

* app.baseUrl
* backend.baseUrl
* backend.cors.origin


[NOTE]
----
You can perform these actions on a best-effort basis and only on OpenShift. During an error or on non-OpenShift clusters, you can still override these defaults by providing a custom app-config ConfigMap.
----

## Mounts for default Secrets and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

You can use annotations to configure mount paths and specify containers for Secrets and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) that are attached to the Operator default resources in your Red Hat Developer Hub deployment. This method is specific for default objects, for instance, the Backstage Deployment that the Operator manages.

### Configuring mount paths for default Secrets and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

By default, the mount path is /opt/app-root/src. To specify a different path, add the rhdh.redhat.com/mount-path annotation to your resource.

1. To specify a PVC mount path, add the rhdh.redhat.com/mount-path annotation to your configuration file as shown in the following example:
Example specifying the PVC mount path

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: <my_claim> # Specifies the PVC to mount
  annotations:
    # Specifies which mount path the PVC mounts to (in this case, /mount/path/from/annotation directory)
    rhdh.redhat.com/mount-path: /mount/path/from/annotation
```

2. To specify a Secret mount path, add the rhdh.redhat.com/mount-path annotation to your configuration file as shown in the following example:
Example specifying where the Secret mounts

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <my_secret> # Specifies the Secret name
  annotations:
    rhdh.redhat.com/mount-path: /mount/path/from/annotation
```


### Mounting Secrets and PVCs to specific containers

By default, Secrets and PVCs mount only to the Red Hat Developer Hub backstage-backend container. You can add the rhdh.redhat.com/containers annotation to your configuration file to specify the containers to mount to.

1. To mount Secrets to all containers, set the rhdh.redhat.com/containers annotation to * in your configuration file:
Example mounting to all containers

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <my_secret>
  annotations:
    rhdh.redhat.com/containers: *
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
Set rhdh.redhat.com/containers to * to mount it to all containers in the deployment.
----
2. To mount to specific containers, separate the names with commas:
Example separating the list of containers

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: <my_claim>
  annotations:
    rhdh.redhat.com/containers: "init-dynamic-plugins,backstage-backend"
```


[NOTE]
----
This configuration mounts the <my_claim> PVC to the init-dynamic-plugins and backstage-backend containers.
----

# Configuring external PostgreSQL databases

As an administrator, you can configure and use external PostgreSQL databases in Red Hat Developer Hub. You can use a PostgreSQL certificate file to configure an external PostgreSQL instance using the Operator or Helm Chart.


[NOTE]
----
Developer Hub supports the configuration of external PostgreSQL databases. You can perform maintenance activities, such as backing up your data or configuring high availability (HA) for the external PostgreSQL databases.
By default, the Red Hat Developer Hub operator or Helm Chart creates a local PostgreSQL database. However, this configuration is not suitable for the production environments. For production deployments, disable the creation of local database and configure Developer Hub to connect to an external PostgreSQL instance instead.
----

## Configuring an external PostgreSQL instance using the Operator

You can configure an external PostgreSQL instance using the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator. By default, the Operator creates and manages a local instance of PostgreSQL in the same namespace where you have deployed the RHDH instance. However, you can change this default setting to configure an external PostgreSQL database server, for example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database Service (RDS) or Azure database.

* You meet the Sizing requirements for external PostgreSQL deployments.
* You are using a supported version of PostgreSQL. For more information, see the Product life cycle page.
* You have the following details:
* db-host: Denotes your PostgreSQL instance Domain Name System (DNS) or IP address
* db-port: Denotes your PostgreSQL instance port number, such as 5432
* username: Denotes the user name to connect to your PostgreSQL instance
* password: Denotes the password to connect to your PostgreSQL instance
* You have installed the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator.
* Optional: You have a CA certificate, Transport Layer Security (TLS) private key, and TLS certificate so that you can secure your database connection by using the TLS protocol. For more information, refer to your PostgreSQL vendor documentation.


[NOTE]
----
By default, Developer Hub uses a database for each plugin and automatically creates it if none is found. You might need the Create Database privilege in addition to PSQL Database privileges for configuring an external PostgreSQL instance.
----

1. Optional: Create a certificate secret to configure your PostgreSQL instance with a TLS connection:

```yaml
cat <<EOF | oc -n my-rhdh-project create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
 name: my-rhdh-database-certificates-secrets 1
type: Opaque
stringData:
 postgres-ca.pem: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  <ca-certificate-key> 2
 postgres-key.key: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  <tls-private-key> 3
 postgres-crt.pem: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  <tls-certificate-key> 4
  # ...
EOF
```

Provide the name of the certificate secret.
Provide the CA certificate key.
Optional: Provide the TLS private key.
Optional: Provide the TLS certificate key.
2. Create a credential secret to connect with the PostgreSQL instance:

```yaml
cat <<EOF | oc -n my-rhdh-project create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
 name: my-rhdh-database-secrets 1
type: Opaque
stringData: 2
 POSTGRES_PASSWORD: <password>
 POSTGRES_PORT: "<db-port>"
 POSTGRES_USER: <username>
 POSTGRES_HOST: <db-host>
 PGSSLMODE: <ssl-mode> # for TLS connection 3
 NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS: <abs-path-to-pem-file> # for TLS connection, e.g. /opt/app-root/src/postgres-crt.pem 4
EOF
```

Provide the name of the credential secret.
Provide credential data to connect with your PostgreSQL instance.
Optional: Provide the value based on the required Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) mode.
Optional: Provide the value only if you need a TLS connection for your PostgreSQL instance.
3. Create your Backstage custom resource (CR):

```terminal
cat <<EOF | oc -n my-rhdh-project create -f -
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha3
kind: Backstage
metadata:
  name: <backstage-instance-name>
spec:
  database:
    enableLocalDb: false 1
  application:
    extraFiles:
      mountPath: <path> # e g /opt/app-root/src
      secrets:
        - name: my-rhdh-database-certificates-secrets 2
          key: postgres-crt.pem, postgres-ca.pem, postgres-key.key # key name as in my-rhdh-database-certificates-secrets Secret
    extraEnvs:
      secrets:
        - name: my-rhdh-database-secrets 3
        # ...
```

Set the value of the enableLocalDb parameter to false to disable creating local PostgreSQL instances.
Provide the name of the certificate secret if you have configured a TLS connection.
Provide the name of the credential secret that you created.

[NOTE]
----
The environment variables listed in the Backstage CR work with the Operator default configuration. If you have changed the Operator default configuration, you must reconfigure the Backstage CR accordingly.
----
4. Apply the Backstage CR to the namespace where you have deployed the Developer Hub instance.

## Configuring an external PostgreSQL instance using the Helm Chart

You can configure an external PostgreSQL instance by using the Helm Chart. By default, the Helm Chart creates and manages a local instance of PostgreSQL in the same namespace where you have deployed the RHDH instance. However, you can change this default setting to configure an external PostgreSQL database server, for example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database Service (RDS) or Azure database.

* You meet the Sizing requirements for external PostgreSQL deployments.
* You are using a supported version of PostgreSQL. For more information, see the Product life cycle page.
* You have the following details:
* db-host: Denotes your PostgreSQL instance Domain Name System (DNS) or IP address
* db-port: Denotes your PostgreSQL instance port number, such as 5432
* username: Denotes the user name to connect to your PostgreSQL instance
* password: Denotes the password to connect to your PostgreSQL instance
* You have installed the RHDH application by using the Helm Chart.
* Optional: You have a CA certificate, Transport Layer Security (TLS) private key, and TLS certificate so that you can secure your database connection by using the TLS protocol. For more information, refer to your PostgreSQL vendor documentation.


[NOTE]
----
By default, Developer Hub uses a database for each plugin and automatically creates it if none is found. You might need the Create Database privilege in addition to PSQL Database privileges for configuring an external PostgreSQL instance.
----

1. Optional: Create a certificate secret to configure your PostgreSQL instance with a TLS connection:

```terminal
cat <<EOF | oc -n <your-namespace> create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
 name: my-rhdh-database-certificates-secrets 1
type: Opaque
stringData:
 postgres-ca.pem: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  <ca-certificate-key> 2
 postgres-key.key: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  <tls-private-key> 3
 postgres-crt.pem: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  <tls-certificate-key> 4
  # ...
EOF
```

Provide the name of the certificate secret.
Provide the CA certificate key.
Optional: Provide the TLS private key.
Optional: Provide the TLS certificate key.
2. Create a credential secret to connect with the PostgreSQL instance:

4. Apply the configuration changes in your Helm configuration file named values.yaml:

```terminal
helm upgrade -n <your-namespace> <your-deploy-name> openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub -f values.yaml --version 1.8.0
```


## Migrating local databases to an external database server using the Operator

By default, Red Hat Developer Hub hosts the data for each plugin in a PostgreSQL database. When you fetch the list of databases, you might see multiple databases based on the number of plugins configured in Developer Hub. You can migrate the data from an RHDH instance hosted on a local PostgreSQL server to an external PostgreSQL service, such as AWS RDS, Azure database, or Crunchy database. To migrate the data from each RHDH instance, you can use PostgreSQL utilities, such as pg_dump with psql or pgAdmin.


[NOTE]
----
The following procedure uses a database copy script to do a quick migration.
----

* You have installed the pg_dump and psql utilities on your local machine.
* For data export, you have the PGSQL user privileges to make a full dump of local databases.
* For data import, you have the PGSQL admin privileges to create an external database and populate it with database dumps.

1. Configure port forwarding for the local PostgreSQL database pod by running the following command on a terminal:

```terminal
oc port-forward -n <your-namespace> <pgsql-pod-name> <forward-to-port>:<forward-from-port>
```


Where:
* The <pgsql-pod-name> variable denotes the name of a PostgreSQL pod with the format backstage-psql-<deployment-name>-<_index>.
* The <forward-to-port> variable denotes the port of your choice to forward PostgreSQL data to.
* The <forward-from-port> variable denotes the local PostgreSQL instance port, such as 5432.
Example: Configuring port forwarding

```terminal
oc port-forward -n developer-hub backstage-psql-developer-hub-0 15432:5432
```

2. Make a copy of the following db_copy.sh script and edit the details based on your configuration:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

to_host=<db-service-host> 1
to_port=5432 2
to_user=postgres 3

from_host=127.0.0.1 4
from_port=15432 5
from_user=postgres 6

allDB=("backstage_plugin_app" "backstage_plugin_auth" "backstage_plugin_catalog" "backstage_plugin_permission" "backstage_plugin_scaffolder" "backstage_plugin_search") 7

for db in ${!allDB[@]};
do
  db=${allDB[$db]}
  echo Copying database: $db
  PGPASSWORD=$TO_PSW psql -h $to_host -p $to_port -U $to_user -c "create database $db;"
  pg_dump -h $from_host -p $from_port -U $from_user -d $db | PGPASSWORD=$TO_PSW psql -h $to_host -p $to_port -U $to_user -d $db
done
```

The destination host name, for example, <db-instance-name>.rds.amazonaws.com.
The destination port, such as 5432.
The destination server username, for example, postgres.
The source host name, such as 127.0.0.1.
The source port number, such as the <forward-to-port> variable.
The source server username, for example, postgres.
The name of databases to import in double quotes separated by spaces, for example, ("backstage_plugin_app" "backstage_plugin_auth" "backstage_plugin_catalog" "backstage_plugin_permission" "backstage_plugin_scaffolder" "backstage_plugin_search").
3. Create a destination database for copying the data:

```terminal
/bin/bash TO_PSW=<destination-db-password> /path/to/db_copy.sh 1
```

The <destination-db-password> variable denotes the password to connect to the destination database.

[NOTE]
----
You can stop port forwarding when the copying of the data is complete. For more information about handling large databases and using the compression tools, see the Handling Large Databases section on the PostgreSQL website.
----
4. Reconfigure your Backstage custom resource (CR). For more information, see Configuring an external PostgreSQL instance using the Operator.
5. Check that the following code is present at the end of your Backstage CR after reconfiguration:

```yaml
# ...
spec:
  database:
    enableLocalDb: false
  application:
  # ...
    extraFiles:
      secrets:
        - name: my-rhdh-database-certificates-secrets
          key: postgres-crt.pem # key name as in my-rhdh-database-certificates-secrets Secret
    extraEnvs:
      secrets:
        - name: my-rhdh-database-secrets
# ...
```


[NOTE]
----
Reconfiguring the Backstage CR deletes the corresponding StatefulSet and Pod objects, but does not delete the PersistenceVolumeClaim object. Use the following command to delete the local PersistenceVolumeClaim object:

```terminal
oc -n developer-hub delete pvc <local-psql-pvc-name>
```

where, the <local-psql-pvc-name> variable is in the data-<psql-pod-name> format.
----
6. Apply the configuration changes.

1. Verify that your RHDH instance is running with the migrated data and does not contain the local PostgreSQL database by running the following command:

```terminal
oc get pods -n <your-namespace>
```

2. Check the output for the following details:
* The backstage-developer-hub-xxx pod is in running state.
* The backstage-psql-developer-hub-0 pod is not available.

You can also verify these details using the Topology view in the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

# Configuring Red Hat Developer Hub deployment when using the Operator

The Red Hat Developer Hub Operator exposes a rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha3 API Version of its custom resource (CR).
This CR exposes a generic spec.deployment.patch field, which gives you full control over the Developer Hub Deployment resource.
This field can be a fragment of the standard apps.Deployment Kubernetes object.

1. Create a Backstage CR with the following fields:


```yaml
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha3
kind: Backstage

  name: developer-hub
spec:
  deployment:
    patch:
      spec:
        template:
```

labels:: Add labels to the Developer Hub pod.
Example adding the label my=true

```yaml
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha3

# Configuring high availability in Red Hat Developer Hub

High availability (HA) is a system design approach that ensures a service remains continuously accessible, even during failures of individual components, by eliminating single points of failure. It introduces redundancy and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime and maintain operational continuity.

Red Hat Developer Hub supports HA deployments on the following platforms:

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
* Azure Kubernetes Service
* Elastic Kubernetes Service
* Google Kubernetes Engine

The HA deployments enable more resilient and reliable service availability across supported environments.

In a single instance deployment, if a failure occurs, whether due to software crashes, hardware issues, or other unexpected disruptions, it would make the entire service unavailable, interrupting development workflows and access to key resources.

With HA enabled, you can scale the number of backend replicas to introduce redundancy. This setup ensures that if one pod or component fails, others continue to serve requests without disruption. The built-in load balancer manages ingress traffic and distributes the load across the available pods. Meanwhile, the RHDH backend manages concurrent requests and resolves resource-level conflicts effectively.

As an administrator, you can configure high availability by adjusting replica values in your configuration file:

* If you installed using the Operator, configure the replica values in your Backstage custom resource.
* If you used the Helm chart, set the replica values in the Helm configuration.

## Configuring high availability in a Red Hat Developer Hub Operator deployment

RHDH instances that are deployed with the Operator use configurations in the Backstage custom resource (CR).
In the Backstage CR, the default value for the replicas field is 1.
If you want to configure your RHDH instance for high availability, you must set replicas to a value greater than 1.

* In your Backstage custom resource (CR), set replicas to a value greater than 1.

For example, to configure two replicas (one backup instance):

```yaml
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha3
kind: Backstage
metadata:
  name: <your_yaml_file>
spec:
  deployment:
    patch:
      spec:
        replicas: 2
```


## Configuring high availability in a Red Hat Developer Hub Helm chart deployment

When you are deploying Developer Hub using the Helm chart, you must set replicas to a value greater than 1 in your Helm chart. The default value for replicas is 1.

* In your Helm chart configuration file, set replicas to a value greater than 1.

For example, to configure two replicas (one backup instance):

```yaml
upstream:
  backstage:
    replicas: 2
```

# Running Red Hat Developer Hub behind a corporate proxy

In a network restricted environment, configure Red Hat Developer Hub to use your proxy to access remote network resources.

You can run the Developer Hub application behind a corporate proxy by setting any of the following environment variables before starting the application:

HTTP_PROXY:: Denotes the proxy to use for HTTP requests.
HTTPS_PROXY:: Denotes the proxy to use for HTTPS requests.
NO_PROXY:: Set the environment variable to bypass the proxy for certain domains. The variable value is a comma-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses that can be accessed without the proxy, even if one is specified.

## The NO_PROXY exclusion rules

NO_PROXY is a comma or space-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses, with optional port numbers. If the input URL matches any of the entries listed in NO_PROXY, a direct request fetches that URL, for example, bypassing the proxy settings.


[NOTE]
----
The default value for NO_PROXY in RHDH is localhost,127.0.0.1. If you want to override it, include at least localhost or localhost:7007 in the list. Otherwise, the RHDH backend might fail.
----

Matching follows the rules below:

* NO_PROXY=* will bypass the proxy for all requests.
* Space and commas might separate the entries in the NO_PROXY list. For example, NO_PROXY="localhost,example.com", or NO_PROXY="localhost example.com", or NO_PROXY="localhost, example.com" would have the same effect.
* If NO_PROXY contains no entries, configuring the HTTP(S)_PROXY settings makes the backend send all requests through the proxy.
* The backend does not perform a DNS lookup to determine if a request should bypass the proxy or not. For example, if DNS resolves example.com to 1.2.3.4, setting NO_PROXY=1.2.3.4 has no effect on requests sent to example.com. Only requests sent to the IP address 1.2.3.4 bypass the proxy.
* If you add a port after the hostname or IP address, the request must match both the host/IP and port to bypass the proxy. For example, NO_PROXY=example.com:1234 would bypass the proxy for requests to http(s)://example.com:1234, but not for requests on other ports, like http(s)://example.com.
* If you do not specify a port after the hostname or IP address, all requests to that host/IP address will bypass the proxy regardless of the port. For example, NO_PROXY=localhost would bypass the proxy for requests sent to URLs like http(s)://localhost:7077 and http(s)://localhost:8888.
* IP Address blocks in CIDR notation will not work. So setting NO_PROXY=10.11.0.0/16 will not have any effect, even if the backend sends a request to an IP address in that block.
* Supports only IPv4 addresses. IPv6 addresses like ::1 will not work.
* Generally, the proxy is only bypassed if the hostname is an exact match for an entry in the NO_PROXY list. The only exceptions are entries that start with a dot (.) or with a wildcard (*). In such a case, bypass the proxy if the hostname ends with the entry.


[NOTE]
----
List the domain and the wildcard domain if you want to exclude a given domain and all its subdomains. For example, you would set NO_PROXY=example.com,.example.com to bypass the proxy for requests sent to http(s)://example.com and http(s)://subdomain.example.com.
----

## Configuring proxy information in Operator deployment

For Operator-based deployment, the approach you use for proxy configuration is based on your role:

* As a cluster administrator with access to the Operator namespace, you can configure the proxy variables in the Operator's default ConfigMap file. This configuration applies the proxy settings to all the users of the Operator.
* As a developer, you can configure the proxy variables in a custom resource (CR) file. This configuration applies the proxy settings to the RHDH application created from that CR.

* You have installed the Red Hat Developer Hub application.

1. Perform one of the following steps based on your role:
* As an administrator, set the proxy information in the Operator's default ConfigMap file:
1. Search for a ConfigMap file named backstage-default-config in the default namespace rhdh-operator and open it.
2. Find the deployment.yaml key.
3. Set the value of the HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NO_PROXY environment variables in the Deployment spec as shown in the following example:
Example: Setting proxy variables in a ConfigMap file

```yaml
# Other fields omitted
  deployment.yaml: |-
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          # Other fields omitted
          initContainers:
            - name: install-dynamic-plugins
              # command omitted
              env:
                - name: NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG
                  value: /opt/app-root/src/.npmrc.dynamic-plugins
                - name: HTTP_PROXY
                  value: 'http://10.10.10.105:3128'
                - name: HTTPS_PROXY
                  value: 'http://10.10.10.106:3128'
                - name: NO_PROXY
                  value: 'localhost,example.org'
              # Other fields omitted
          containers:
            - name: backstage-backend
              # Other fields omitted
              env:
                - name: APP_CONFIG_backend_listen_port
                  value: "7007"
                - name: HTTP_PROXY
                  value: 'http://10.10.10.105:3128'
                - name: HTTPS_PROXY
                  value: 'http://10.10.10.106:3128'
                - name: NO_PROXY
                  value: 'localhost,example.org'
```

* As a developer, set the proxy information in your Backstage CR file as shown in the following example:
Example: Setting proxy variables in a CR file

```yaml
spec:
  # Other fields omitted
  application:
    extraEnvs:
      envs:
        - name: HTTP_PROXY
          value: 'http://10.10.10.105:3128'
        - name: HTTPS_PROXY
          value: 'http://10.10.10.106:3128'
        - name: NO_PROXY
          value: 'localhost,example.org'
```

2. Save the configuration changes.

## Configuring proxy information in Helm deployment

For Helm-based deployment, either a developer or a cluster administrator with permissions to create resources in the cluster can configure the proxy variables in a values.yaml Helm configuration file.

* You have installed the Red Hat Developer Hub application.

1. Set the proxy information in your Helm configuration file:

```yaml
upstream:
  backstage:
    extraEnvVars:
      - name: HTTP_PROXY
        value: '<http_proxy_url>'
      - name: HTTPS_PROXY
        value: '<https_proxy_url>'
      - name: NO_PROXY
        value: '<no_proxy_settings>'
```


Where,
<http_proxy_url>:: Denotes a variable that you must replace with the HTTP proxy URL.
<https_proxy_url>:: Denotes a variable that you must replace with the HTTPS proxy URL.
<no_proxy_settings>:: Denotes a variable that you must replace with comma-separated URLs, which you want to exclude from proxying, for example, foo.com,baz.com.
Example: Setting proxy variables using Helm Chart

```yaml
upstream:
  backstage:
    extraEnvVars:
      - name: HTTP_PROXY
        value: 'http://10.10.10.105:3128'
      - name: HTTPS_PROXY
        value: 'http://10.10.10.106:3128'
      - name: NO_PROXY
        value: 'localhost,example.org'
```

# Configuring an RHDH instance with a TLS connection in Kubernetes

You can configure a RHDH instance with a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection in a Kubernetes cluster, such as an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) cluster, any cluster from a supported cloud provider, or your own cluster with proper configuration. Transport Layer Security (TLS) ensures a secure connection for the RHDH instance with other entities, such as third-party applications, or external databases. However, you must use a public Certificate Authority (CA)-signed certificate to configure your Kubernetes cluster.

* You have set up an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) cluster with a public CA-signed certificate. For more information about obtaining CA certificates, refer to your vendor documentation.
* You have created a namespace and setup a service account with proper read permissions on resources.
Example: Kubernetes manifest for role-based access control

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: backstage-read-only
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - '*'
    resources:
      - pods
      - configmaps
      - services
      - deployments
      - replicasets
      - horizontalpodautoscalers
      - ingresses
      - statefulsets
      - limitranges
      - resourcequotas
      - daemonsets
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
#...
```

* You have obtained the secret and the service CA certificate associated with your service account.
* You have created some resources and added annotations to them so they can be discovered by the Kubernetes plugin. You can apply these Kubernetes annotations:
* backstage.io/kubernetes-id to label components
* backstage.io/kubernetes-namespace to label namespaces

1. Enable the Kubernetes plugins in the dynamic-plugins-rhdh.yaml file:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: dynamic-plugins-rhdh
data:
  dynamic-plugins.yaml: |
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-kubernetes-backend-dynamic
        disabled: false 1
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-kubernetes
        disabled: false 2
        # ...
```

Set the value to false to enable the backstage-plugin-kubernetes-backend-dynamic plugin.
Set the value to false to enable the backstage-plugin-kubernetes plugin.

[NOTE]
----
The backstage-plugin-kubernetes plugin is currently in Technology Preview. As an alternative, you can use the ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-topology-dynamic plugin, which is Generally Available (GA).
----
2. Set the Kubernetes cluster details and configure the catalog sync options in the app-config.yaml configuration file.

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-rhdh-app-config
data:
  "app-config.yaml": |
  # ...
  catalog:
    rules:
      - allow: [Component, System, API, Resource, Location]
    providers:
      kubernetes:
        openshift:
          cluster: openshift
          processor:
            namespaceOverride: default
            defaultOwner: guests
          schedule:
            frequency:
              seconds: 30
            timeout:
              seconds: 5
  kubernetes:
    serviceLocatorMethod:
      type: 'multiTenant'
    clusterLocatorMethods:
      - type: 'config'
        clusters:
          - url: <target-cluster-api-server-url> 1
            name: openshift
            authProvider: 'serviceAccount'
            skipTLSVerify: false 2
            skipMetricsLookup: true
            dashboardUrl: <target-cluster-console-url> 3
            dashboardApp: openshift
            serviceAccountToken: ${K8S_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN} 4
            caData: ${K8S_CONFIG_CA_DATA} 5
            # ...
```

The base URL to the Kubernetes control plane. You can run the kubectl cluster-info command to get the base URL.
Set the value of this parameter to false to enable the verification of the TLS certificate.
Optional: The link to the Kubernetes dashboard managing the ARO cluster.
Optional: Pass the service account token using a K8S_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN environment variable that you define in your <my_product_secrets> secret.
Pass the CA data using a K8S_CONFIG_CA_DATA environment variable that you define in your <my_product_secrets> secret.
3. Save the configuration changes.

1. Run the RHDH application to import your catalog:

```terminal
kubectl -n rhdh-operator get pods -w
```

2. Verify that the pod log shows no errors for your configuration.
3. Go to Catalog and check the component page in the Developer Hub instance to verify the cluster connection and the presence of your created resources.


[NOTE]
----
If you encounter connection errors, such as certificate issues or permissions, check the message box in the component page or view the logs of the pod.

# Using the dynamic plugins cache

## Using the dynamic plugins cache

The dynamic plugins cache in Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) enhances the installation process and reduces platform boot time by storing previously installed plugins.
If the configuration remains unchanged, this feature prevents the need to re-download plugins on subsequent boots.

When you enable dynamic plugins cache:

* The system calculates a checksum of each plugin's YAML configuration (excluding pluginConfig).
* The checksum is stored in a file named dynamic-plugin-config.hash within the plugin's directory.
* During boot, if a plugin's package reference matches the previous installation and the checksum is unchanged, the download is skipped.
* Plugins that are disabled since the previous boot are automatically removed.


[NOTE]
----
To enable the dynamic plugins cache in RHDH, the plugins directory dynamic-plugins-root must be a persistent volume.
----

## Creating a PVC for the dynamic plugin cache by using the Operator

For operator-based installations, you must manually create the persistent volume claim (PVC) by replacing the default dynamic-plugins-root volume with a PVC named dynamic-plugins-root.

* You have installed Red Hat Developer Hub on OpenShift Container Platform using the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Create the persistent volume definition and save it to a file, such as pvc.yaml. For example:

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: dynamic-plugins-root
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```


[NOTE]
----
This example uses ReadWriteOnce as the access mode which prevents multiple replicas from sharing the PVC across different nodes.
To run multiple replicas on different nodes, depending on your storage driver, you must use an access mode such as ReadWriteMany.
----
2. To apply this PVC to your cluster, run the following command:

```terminal
oc apply -f pvc.yaml
```

3. Replace the default dynamic-plugins-root volume with a PVC named dynamic-plugins-root. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha3
kind: Backstage
metadata:
  name: developer-hub
spec:
  deployment:
    patch:
      spec:
        template:
          spec:
            volumes:
              - $patch: replace
                name: dynamic-plugins-root
                persistentVolumeClaim:
                  claimName: dynamic-plugins-root
```


[NOTE]
----
To avoid adding a new volume, you must use the $patch: replace directive.
----

## Creating a PVC for the dynamic plugin cache using the Helm Chart

For Helm chart installations, if you require the dynamic plugin cache to persist across pod restarts, you must create a persistent volume claim (PVC) and configure the Helm chart to use it.

* You have installed Red Hat Developer Hub using the Helm chart.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Create the persistent volume definition.
For example:

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: dynamic-plugins-root
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```


[NOTE]
----
This example uses ReadWriteOnce as the access mode which prevents multiple replicas from sharing the PVC across different nodes.
To run multiple replicas on different nodes, depending on your storage driver, you must use an access mode such as ReadWriteMany.
----
2. To apply this PVC to your cluster, run the following command:

```terminal
oc apply -f pvc.yaml
```

3. Configure the Helm chart to use the PVC.
For example:

```yaml
upstream:
  backstage:
    extraVolumes:
      - name: dynamic-plugins-root
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: dynamic-plugins-root
      - name: dynamic-plugins
        configMap:
          defaultMode: 420
          name: '{{ printf "%s-dynamic-plugins" .Release.Name }}'
          optional: true
      - name: dynamic-plugins-npmrc
        secret:
          defaultMode: 420
          optional: true
          secretName: '{{ printf "%s-dynamic-plugins-npmrc" .Release.Name }}'
      - name: dynamic-plugins-registry-auth
        secret:
          defaultMode: 416
          optional: true
          secretName: '{{ printf "%s-dynamic-plugins-registry-auth" .Release.Name }}'
      - name: npmcacache
        emptyDir: {}
      - name: temp
        emptyDir: {}
```


[NOTE]
----
When you configure the Helm chart to use the PVC, you must also include the extraVolumes section defined in the default Helm chart values.
----

## Configuring the dynamic plugins cache

* To configure the dynamic plugins cache, set the following optional dynamic plugin cache parameters in your dynamic-plugins.yaml file:
pullPolicy: IfNotPresent (default):: Download the artifact if it is not already present in the dynamic-plugins-root folder, without checking image digests.
pullPolicy: Always:: Compare the image digest in the remote registry and downloads the artifact if it has changed, even if Developer Hub has already downloaded the plugin before.

When applied to the Node Package Manager (NPM) downloading method, download the remote artifact without a digest check.

Example dynamic-plugins.yaml file configuration to download the remote artifact without a digest check:

```yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: false
    pullPolicy: Always
    package: 'oci://quay.io/example-org/example-plugin:v1.0.0!internal-backstage-plugin-example'
```

forceDownload: false (default):: Older option to download the artifact if it is not already present in the dynamic-plugins-root folder, without checking image digests.
forceDownload: true:: Older option to force a reinstall of the plugin, bypassing the cache.

[NOTE]
----
The pullPolicy option takes precedence over the forceDownload option.
The forceDownload option might become deprecated in a future Developer Hub release.
----

# Enabling the Red Hat Developer Hub plugin assets cache

By default, Red Hat Developer Hub does not cache plugin assets.
You can use a Redis cache store to improve Developer Hub performance and reliability.
Configured plugins in Developer Hub receive dedicated cache connections, which are powered by the Keyv Redis client.

* You have installed Red Hat Developer Hub.
* You have an active Redis server.
For more information on setting up an external Redis server, see the official Redis documentation.

1. Enable the Developer Hub cache by defining Redis as the cache store type and entering your Redis server connection URL in your app-config.yaml file.
app-config.yaml file fragment

```yaml
backend:
  cache:
    store: redis
    connection: redis://user:pass@cache.example.com:6379
```

2. Enable the cache for Techdocs by adding the techdocs.cache.ttl setting in your app-config.yaml file.
This setting specifies how long, in milliseconds, a statically built asset should stay in the cache.
app-config.yaml file fragment

```yaml
techdocs:
  cache:
    ttl: 3600000
```



[TIP]
----
Optionally, enable the cache for unsupported plugins that support this feature.
See their respective documentation for details.
