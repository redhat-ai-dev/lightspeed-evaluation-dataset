# Upgrading Red Hat Developer Hub

# Upgrading the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator

If you use the Operator to deploy your Red Hat Developer Hub instance, then an administrator can use the OpenShift Container Platform web console to upgrade the Operator to a later version.

OpenShift Container Platform is currently supported from version 4.16 to 4.19. See also the Red Hat Developer Hub Life Cycle.

* You are logged in as an administrator on the OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You have installed the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator.
* You have configured the appropriate roles and permissions within your project to create or access an application. For more information, see the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation on Building applications.

1. In the Administrator perspective of the OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators > Installed Operators.
2. On the Installed Operators page, click Red Hat Developer Hub Operator.
3. On the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator page, click the Subscription tab.
4. From the Upgrade status field on the Subscription details page, click Upgrade available.

# Upgrading the Red Hat Developer Hub Helm Chart

You can upgrade to a later version of Red Hat Developer Hub in OpenShift Container Platform by using either the web console or the CLI.

2. Click the overflow menu on the Helm release that you want to use and select Upgrade.
3. On the Upgrade Helm Release page, select the version of Developer Hub that you want to upgrade to from the chart version drop-down list.
4. Click Upgrade.

[NOTE]
----
It might take a few minutes to delete the resources in the older versions and to start the newer versions of the Developer Hub pods.
----
5. Close all open Developer Hub web pages, and log in again to verify that the upgrade was successful.
* OpenShift Container Platform CLI
1. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster as the cluster administrator and switch to the project or namespace in which Developer Hub was installed.

```terminal
oc login -u <user> -p <password> https://api.<HOSTNAME>:6443
oc project my-rhdh-project
```

2. For a new version of the Developer Hub Helm chart, run the following upgrade command:

```terminal
helm upgrade -i rhdh -f new-values.yml \
  openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub --version 1.8.0
```


[NOTE]
----
You can also provide extra values to the chart by creating a new-values.yml file on your workstation with values that override the attributes in the installed chart or by adding new attributes.
